It is popular in the Caucasus because of it's excellent armor piercing capabilities (up to 6mm of steel plating at 100m) and it's silence. They were only ever given in any number to Spetsnaz units, so I assume the mujahideen get them as ghanima from them. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSS_Vintorez",2009,04,23,2009-04-23 00:00:00.000,1403
76,10118,813,Images from Islamic Emirate of Caucasus,343,Asad'Allah,"Caliber: 9x39 mm (SP-5, SP-6) Action: Gas operated, rotating bolt with 6 lugs Length: 875 mm / 615 mm (stock open / folded) Barrel length: 200 mm Effective range: 400 meters Weight: 2,96 kg empty Magazine capacity: 10 or 20 rounds The Special Forces, generally known as “Spetsnaz” (after the Russian term “Voiska Spetsialnogo Naznacheniya” – Special Purpose Troops), always played a key role in Soviet Military Doctrine. One of the aspects of every Special Forces is that they prefer to operate stealthily, with as little sound and flash as possible from their weapons. The first generation Spetsnaz weapons were no more than AK and AKM rifles, fitted with quick-detachable sound suppressors, and loaded with special subsonic ammunition with heavy bullets. Apparently, this was not enough, since in the mid-1980s the development of new, more effective silenced weapons was initiated. At first, designers from TSNIITOCHMASH in the city of Klimovsk developed a special-purpose 9 mm subsonic cartridges, known as 9x39 SP-5 and SP-6, based on necked-out 7.62 x 39 case. These cartridges were fitted with heavy (about 16-17 gram) standard “ball” or armour piercing bullets, with muzzle velocities about 280-300 metres per second. Having the ammunition, the team at TSNIITOCHMASH, lead by P. Serdyukov, developed a family of integrally silenced 9 mm weapons, which included the VSS “Vintorez” silenced sniper rifle and the AS “Val” silenced assault rifle. Both weapons are based on the same action and integrally silenced barrel. AS is widely used by Russian Army recon units, as well as by MVD (Internal Affairs Ministry) and FSB (Federal Security Bureau) Special Forces. The AS is a gas operated, integrally silenced weapon. The receiver is machined from steel forging for improved strength. The long stroke gas piston is located above the barrel, and rigidly attached to the bolt carrier. The rotating bolt has six lugs and locks into the receiver. The front part of the barrel, ahead of the gas port, has several sets of holes, drilled at the bottom of the rifling grooves. These holes are used to bleed some of the gun gas into the integral silencer. The trigger unit is somewhat similar to that of the Czech-made Sa. Vz.58 assault rifle, and is striker-fired. The safety lever is similar to the one found on all Kalashnikov-type rifles, but the fire mode selector is a separate cross-bolt type button, located within the trigger guard, just behind the trigger. The open sights are graduated up to 400 meters in 25 meter increments, but the actual effective range is about 200-300 meters due to the rainbow-shaped trajectory of the subsonic bullets. The AS is optimized for high performance armor piercing 9 x 39 ammunition, designated as SP-6, but can also fire “ball” type SP-5 ammunition, intended for VSS sniper rifles. The pistol grip and the short forearm are made from polymer, the skeletonized, side-folding butt is made from steel tubing. The AS rifle has a standard side-mounted rail for optical, night vision or red dot scopes. It has no provision for mounting a bayonet or a grenade launcher. The integral silencer could be easily detached for maintenance, repair, or compact storage, but the rifle shall not be fired with the silencer removed due to safety and reliability issues. --",2009,04,23,2009-04-23 00:00:00.000,1403

The fatality comes just a day after Prime Minister Gordon Brown's visit to Afghanistan, where he put forward a new security strategy for the region, as international alarm spreads over Taliban advances. The soldier, from the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, was killed while on foot patrol alongside the Afghan National Army near the Forward Operating Base Keenan, north east of Gereshk, in Helmand province. The Ministry of Defence said the cause of the blast was under investigation. British troops in Helmand will be reinforced in coming weeks by the arrival of 8,000 U.S. marines which NATO commanders hope will reverse what they have described as a stalemate in one of the country's most violent provinces. Britain has more than 8,000 troops based in Afghanistan, the vast majority serving in Helmand, a desert province that remains a heartland of the Taliban-led insurgency. More than 150 members of the British armed forces have died in Afghanistan since late 2001 when U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power. Reuters",2009,04,28,2009-04-28 00:00:00.000,2051

The American newspaper, the Wall Street Journal, quoting sources in the Pentagon, wrote that those Internet sites and radio stations that according to them belong to or are attributed to the Taleban or are supporting them would be closed down. The Pentagon has reasoned that these Internet sites and media sources not only have no legal licences but also make a large number of people side with the Taleban and incite them against America and its allies, and in doing so further weaken the Kabul administration. First of all it should be made clear that the Americans for the past four to five years have made widespread and continuous efforts to silence and foil these websites and stations that they now wish to close down. This is not a new step or a fresh effort when they say they will disrupt the Taleban media sources or broadcasts. In the past they have spared no effohe Americans should feel really ashamed that despite their huge material strength and superiority they are afraid of a few local Internet sites and FM radio stations, which cannot operate outside a 20 km radius, that the Pentagon intervenes and regards these limited and few sources as a great threat. This is despite the fact that the Americans alone in Afghanistan or outside it have started hundreds of radio and television stations and thousands of newspapers, publications and magazine to spread poisonous, false and hateful propaganda against the Taleban and to hide huge casualties and losses inflicted on them every day by the Taleban so that no publication, news agency or website could give the exact number of American losses of life and material on a daily basis in various parts of Afghanistan. It is these countless pro-American and dollar-stuffed news sources that for the past eight yea Those world organizations and institutions, which claim to uphold the freedom of expression, idea and pen, should condemn or foil this inadmissible American effort or at least seriously denounce it if they are really committed to these claims and slogans.",2009,05,03,2009-05-03 00:00:00.000,11157

1613,12556,4444,"Videos, images and news regarding taliban mujahideen",1137,taliban_mujahid_1,"Obama's new strategy and the defeated America During the past few weeks, the American-serving media has been spreading propaganda and diverting the world's attention away from the true situation in Afghanistan. Obama and other U.S. officials have been announcing a new military and political strategy for Afghanistan, Pakistan and the region, which they claim will be a positive and important step forward for the entire world. In actuality, these policies are doomed to failure and are only an escalation of Bush's murderous agenda. However, those who know America inside out and are aware of its imperialistic policies and its foul desire to devour the world. People have learned that they should never expect good and compassion from America. Additionally, the people of the world have begun to invest less and less trust in the charming words and idle promises of American officials. Therefore, the people of the world must be discerning, resilient, and slow to follow America's greatest charmer yet. The Afghan Mujahid nation has always known that there is no positive message or promise for Afghanistan and its people in Obama's rhetoric, desires, and election. This is because on the first day of his election, Obama showed his commitment for the continuation and extension of Bush's war-mongering policies by saying that he would send more troops to Afghanistan and would further intensify the ongoing war there. However, it was the Western media which relentlessly and falsely publicized Obama's directions and policies as something that would save America's current failing military and its economic crises and would restore America's image after its isolation in the world as a result of Bush's hated policies. When on Obama presented his military plan under the name of a new strategy for Afghanistan and the region that he will be sending extra troops to Afghanistan, will be opening a new front against the courageous tribes and will be using all his power to prevent the establishment of an Islamic system in Afghanistan and the growth of religious ideology, he proved that the American leadership is still too stubborn to willingly put an end to the current invasion and occupation of Afghanistan. Obama's strategy of hostility made it clear that this time America intends to make Afghanistan accessible to a number of its neighbours to directly interfere in it under the pretext of contacts and communication and provide them the opportunity to divide Afghanistan and its people on the basis of region, religion and language. From the point of view of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, Obama's new strategy has already been tested to a great extent before him by Bush, who despite of his seven years of terror, conspiracies and schemes, did not succeed in weakening the morale of the current jihad under the leadership of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, or gain the support of the Afghan nation, or give authority and legitimacy to the Kabul puppet administration at least inside Kabul. Now by the Grace of Allah, the Mujahideen are in control of a large part of the country, and the Afghan nation is a supporter and exponent of the resistance and jihad against the invaders, it would be a clear proof and also evidence of Obama's lack of knowledge and ignorance if he still hopes of victory and progress in Afghanistan by pressing the failed strategy of sending several thousand more troops or with the pledge of crushing the tribes. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan tells the Obama's new administration in no uncertain terms that the Afghan people will not rest and will not stop jihad and resistance as long as a single invading soldier remains in Afghanistan. Perhaps it will be the historical courage and honour of the Afghan nation that the invaders will face eternal defeat at their hands, God willing.",2009,05,04,2009-05-04 00:00:00.000,11157

Al Shabaab hardliners in the southern port of Kismayo constructed large screens to portray real-life film footage recorded from ""wars in Somalia, Palestine and Afghanistan."" Kismayo residents described the films as bloody and violent, showing gruesome images of civilians being killed by foreign militaries. ""If I take Mogadishu for example, the films showed Ethiopian troops and AMISOM [African Union] troops shelling civilian areas, causing many deaths,"" said one film viewer. Some of the films showed Israeli armed forces bombarding civilians neighborhoods in Gaza and the West Bank, the viewers added. A spokesman for Al Shabaab said the films are intended to show the public the ""suffering of Muslims"" across the world. He noted that the films will soon be shown in other areas under Al Shabaab control, including Bay, Bakool, Gedo and Lower Shabelle regions. Gravesites At least 12 gravesites were destroyed in the outskirts of Kismayo this week by Al Shabaab, fighters and residents said. Sheikh Fu'ad Abdullahi, who a senior member of Al Shabaab, said the gravesites were destroyed as part of an ""ongoing process."" ""The destroyed gravesites were places where people worshipped, and this is forbidden by Islam,"" Sheikh Fu'ad told reporters. The town of Kamsuma, which is located 90km north of Kismayo, was the site where many religious scholars were buried, with some graves reportedly older than a century. Heavy fighting erupted in central Somalia's Galgadud region in late 2008 between Al Shabaab and Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jamee'a, a Sufi group, with reporting linking the eruption of that conflict to Al Shabaab desecration of gravesites.

Military sources and residents in Mogadishu said missiles, armed trucks and munitions have been transported to the capital over the past two days. Heavy weapons were seen entering Mogadishu from Daynile district, located in the outskirts of the capital. Some of the weaponry was stationed in the district and other weapons were spread out to opposition strongholds in Mogadishu, the sources added. It is not clear where the weapons are coming from, but insiders speculated that the weapons are arriving from Lower Jubba and Lower Shabelle, both regions under the control of Al Shabaab. A source close to Hizbul Islam, another opposition faction, said the armed group is ""preparing for all-out war"" against AMISOM peacekeepers and the Somali interim government. The arrival of heavy weapons in Mogadishu comes on a week Somali government officials have accused the Eritrean government of transporting a planeload of weapons to a military airstrip in Lower Shabelle region.

1905,13050,2970,Al-Fursan Media: First English Jihad Magazine - Jihad Recollections no. 1,930,wa1slama,"Friday, May 01, 2009 By Eric Shawn It's been likened to Al Qaeda's ""Vanity Fair,"" a new English-language Internet magazine called ""Jihad Recollections"" that focuses on the terrorist group, its founder, Usama Bin Laden, and how to commit jihad. It also predicts the demise of the United States. “This is designed for Americans,” says noted terrorism expert Steven Emerson, founder of the Investigative Project on Terrorism in Washington, D.C., and author of the book ""American Jihad: The Terrorists Living Among Us."" “It’s not for Brits, not for Germans, not for jihadists in the Middle East. It’s designed for Americans and it’s designed to get them to convert to Islam or to carry out jihad acts of terror,” he said. “What started off as some angry kids in their basement has transformed over the past several years into a robust Al Qaeda propaganda outlet right here in our backyard,” says Jarret Brachman, an Al Qaeda specialist and author of the new book, “Global Jihadism.” Brachman says “it raises the bar for pro-Al Qaeda propaganda in English. Its presentation is flashier than any English language Al Qaeda propaganda that we’ve seen to date.” He also says “the publication shows how deeply embedded in the global Al Qaeda movement its editors are.” It is not clear what connection, if any, the magazine has to Al Qaeda or its followers. It is published by the “Al Fursan Media Foundation,” but FOX News could not find such an organization or a way to contact them for comment. Yet “Jihad Recollections” certainly highlights the terrorist group and the goals of Islamic jihad in a sophisticated and graphically slick presentation similar to any high quality Web site. The magazine includes the speeches and writings of Bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Articles range from “Four Practical Steps to Expand the Global Jihad,” to “The Science Behind Night Vision Technology” and “Principles of Guerrilla Warfare.” “The magazine is quite startling,” said Emerson. It is “a veritable manual on how to carry out terrorism. It’s quite shocking, and the question is whether it violates the law or not.” The first issue says of the 9/11 attacks, that “the strategy was genius.” It calls America “one of the most atrocious and egotistical regimes to date,” and it accuses the United States of spreading corruption in Islamic countries through its embassies. “How can we expect from America any good?” it asks. “We only expect from it every evil and corruption.” “Jihad Recollections” appears to prepare followers to engage in jihad. One section teaches aspiring jihadists how to stay in shape by doing exercise without weights. Articles with photographs of men dressed in white robes with their faces covered encourage them to exercise at home and stay away from American gyms because “they are full of music, semi-naked women, free mixing.” It warns of the dangers of “showing off” during a workout and even observes that protein shakes are too expensive and not worth the money. For those who thought the election of Barack Obama as president would assuage the militant world, the magazine makes it quite clear that is not the case. “To the Muslims who voted for Obama and were optimistic that he would make a positive change ... nothing will change except things can only get worse,” the magazine proclaims. “Only Allah knows how much worse it will get.” The magazine criticizes the Obama economic stimulus plan, calling it “flawed,” and ridicules the president as “Mr. Yes We Can,” whose policies will “continue to loot all the hardworking Americans wealth.” It even includes the views of some prominent critics of the president’s polices, such as former New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey, now an adjunct fellow at the Hudson Institute, and veteran Tennessee Rep. Zach Wamp, the ranking Republican on the House Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee. Such references clearly indicate an awareness of American political discourse similar to the nation’s political policy magazines. In fact, “Jihad Recollections” proclaims: “It is the first of its kind as it is geared towards the English speaking Muslims who are interested in gaining heights in their religious, political, economical, social, technological, strategic, historical, biographical and health awareness.” The writing may be a bit flamboyant, and while it boasts that “The U.S. grows weaker every day,” there is no explicit call for violence against the country or against Americans. Emerson thinks the publication is “pushing the envelope of the First Amendment” by reporting on jihad issues, and he says it indicates that the Internet is being used as “one of the major sources for radicalization.” “Thousands of people have accessed these pro-Al Qaeda websites,” notes Brachman. He says “this new journal is receiving more and more praise from within the English-language jihadist movement. The fact is that their movement is growing — their popularity is growing.” More than 5,000 people have viewed “Jihad Recollections” and 11 people list it as one of their “favorites.” Who are its readers? And do they adhere to the jihad philosophy? Whoever is behind “Jihad Recollections” has a strange mix of opinion with one focus: seemingly to spread the message of Islamic jihad at the expense of Americans. That such a publication is accessible at all speaks to the freedoms we enjoy in our country while, experts say, also serving as a warning of the danger that Islamic militants and radicals pose to our nation.

3464,15479,1893,Latest News About The Mujahideen In Somalia,930,wa1slama,"ADDIS ABABA (Sh. M. Network)— A deadly offensive in Somalia by Islamist rebels threatening to topple the government poses risks to the security of neighbouring countries as well, regional countries said Wednesday. Six east African nations went into emergency talks following renewed fighting in Somali which has claimed more than 100 lives and displaced 43,000 in just under two weeks. ""It is no longer a war between Somalis, but a war against Somalia, a war against all of us,"" said Mahboub Maalim, the secretary general of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD). Speaking at the talks in the capital of Ethiopia, which witnesses say has re-deployed to Somalia amid the Islamist rebel onslaught, Maalim said there was a ""need to harmonise the actions of the member states as much as we can."" ""We need to change the scope,"" he said at the meeting of foreign ministers from Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Djibouti, Sudan and Uganda. Ethiopia has denied crossing back into Somalia, where it previously shored up government troops for slightly over two years since late 2006. Ethiopia's foreign minister, Seyoum Mesfin, who is chairing the talks, warned against delayed intervention to help the embattled interim government. ""It is always more difficult to reverse a dangerous process when it is too late,"" said Seyoum. ""Extremists are not interested in peace. Their agenda has nothing to do with the stabilisation of Somalia. Their plans are going beyond Somalia,"" he said. African Union chief Jean Ping renewed calls for a UN-sponsored peacekeeing force in the Horn of Africa state that has not known peace since 1991. The situation is ""deteriorating ... due to an unprecedented level of violence in Mogadishu,"" said Ping. ""I wish to once again call on the UN Security Council to authorise the deployment of a fully-fledged peacekeeping mission in Somalia and respond to the threat to the international peace and security,"" said Ping. A UN Security Council delegation over the weekend said that conditions have not yet been met for deploying UN peacekeepers in Somalia.(AFP)",2009,05,20,2009-05-20 00:00:00.000,3545

3550,15612,1893,Latest News About The Mujahideen In Somalia,930,wa1slama,"MOGADISHU, May 20 (Reuters) - Somalia's prime minister said on Wednesday there was little hope of negotiating with hardline Islamist insurgents because they had no political agenda and just wanted to use the Horn of Africa nation as a safe haven. Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke was appointed by Somalia's first Islamist president earlier this year and said in February he hoped to use dialogue to end the violence that has plagued the country for nearly two decades. But hardline Islamist groups that Washington accuses of having links to al Qaeda, along with foreign fighters, are battling government forces in some of the fiercest clashes the anarchic country has seen for months. ""I do not think they have a political agenda. I believe these foreign fighters want to keep this country in chaos so they can have a safe haven and a hideout,"" Sharmarke said. ""I don't think there is a chance to just sit with them and discuss issues with these people. The only way to deal with them that they can understand is to fight, and we are prepared to eradicate them,"" he told Reuters in an interview. The United Nations says there are hundreds of foreign fighters from Africa, Asia and elsewhere in the rebel ranks. Neighbouring states and Western security forces fear the country could become a base for al Qaeda-linked Islamist militants. Somalia's nine million people have paid a heavy price for the chaos and violence. More than one million live as internal refugees and hundreds of thousands have poured across the borders into neighbours Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti. Piracy is rampant off Somalia with nearly 30 hijackings so far this year in some of the world's busiest sea lanes. Naval vessels from the United States, EU and other nations have been drawn into patrolling the waters off Somalia. WEAPONS FROM ERITREA Sharmarke said government forces were chasing some 300 foreign fighters in the ranks of hardline group al Shabaab out of Mogadishu, but there were more outside the capital. ""Shabaab and its foreign fighters can never govern. They can go to a town, hit and run, destroy it and terrorise the people, but these people have no capacity, capability and moral support to govern,"" he said. ""I still wonder how people can keep fighting with no objectives. On top of that they have failed to use religion as a tool. These guys have violated every principle in Islam, and still claim they are Islamists."" Al Shabaab fighters control much of southern and central Somalia. While they have brought security to some areas, their strict interpretation of Islamic law has angered some Somalis who are traditionally more moderate. This week, al Shabaab and allied group Hizbul Islam have been fighting the Sunni Islamst group Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca, which objects to acts against Islam such as the killing of religious leaders and the desecration of graves. Sharmarke blamed Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki for supplying the insurgents with weapons. Earlier on Wednesday, the east African bloc IGAD called on the United Nations to impose immediate sanctions on Eritrea. [ID:nLK24549] Eritrea said earlier this month it was sick of the persistent accusations and in turn accused Western powers of interfering in Somalia and fuelling strife. ""We have enough evidence that Eritrea is supplying weapons to Somali factions, so many flights have actually arrived. And that is very sad,"" said Sharmarke.

4851,17999,2140,Jihad Unspun Founder about to be beheaded?,605,assassin,"May 30, 2009 Taliban keep grip on kidnapped Canadian By Syed Saleem Shahzad KARACHI - For Pakistan, there are still two kinds of Taliban - the good and the bad. Hafiz Gul Bahadur of the North Waziristan tribal area is reckoned as good Taliban. He is Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud's rival and has signed a ceasefire agreement with the Pakistani security forces. Being a member of the Shura of Mujahideen, he only fights against foreign forces in Afghanistan. However, his involvement in the abduction late last year in Bunna, North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), of Canadian journalist Beverly Giesbrecht, who converted to Islam and who is now known as Khadija Abdul Qahhar, exposes the problems of dealing even with ""good"" Taliban, and the mess they can cause because of their connections with Pakistan. People involved in the backroom negotiations for the release of Khadija, 52, say that she suffered heart problems this week and that her condition is serious. She has a history of heart problems. But the militants holding her will not release her as there is still haggling over the amount of ransom to be paid. ""We had set up all the measures for her release,"" former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) official, retired Squadron leader Khalid Khawaja, told Asia Times Online on Friday. He has been involved in the negotiations for the release of Khadija and her translator Suleman, 18. ""Maulana Fazlur Rahman [the chief of the Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Islam party, a coalition partner in the federal government] was involved on behalf of the Canadian government. Initially, the militants did not want to release her, saying she was an American proxy. ""But after Fazlur's involvement, they agreed to let her go for a sum of 60 million rupees [US$740,000]. The deal was finalized and the Canadian government had arranged the money. Then [a few weeks ago] another development took place and everything was spoiled,"" said Khawaja. ""Everything was being routed through the political agent in North Waziristan [the representative of the federal government]. He demanded that he receive 50% of the payment. According to him, a portion of the money had to go to Governor's House in Peshawar [capital of NWFP], which would then pass on a share to the President's Office in Islamabad. ""This demand [which meant the Canadians would have to pay an additional 30 million rupees] needed new approvals in the Canadian system, and the Canadians lost interest,"" said Khawaja. In April 2002 - the month she converted to Islam - Khadija launched Jihad Unspun, an aggregation Internet site for news and opinions related to the Middle East and the ""war on terror"". It was considered strongly anti-American. ""Now we are getting information that Khadija has had a heart attack, but the militants are not ready to release her. Our strongest link to the militants was Shah Abdul Aziz [a former member of parliament on whose advice Khadija had fatefully traveled to Bunna]. But he was apprehended by the security agencies on Wednesday, and now our only option is to appeal to the militants through the press,"" Khawaja said. Asia Times Online tried to reach two spokesmen at the President's Office - Farhatullah Babar and Farhanaz Ispahani - but neither responded.

5105,18401,4444,"Videos, images and news regarding taliban mujahideen",1137,taliban_mujahid_1,"A New American Chief Executive and the Election Drama The Americans have launched a ridiculous chess game about their stooges, tapping them on the back to run for the president. Even, US president Obama invited some of them to participate in a swearing-in ceremony at the White House. By such gestures, Obama intended to show that he wanted to get a particular agent installed at the saddle of power in Afghanistan and end the Karzai corruption-ridden Administration. However, it did not transpire. After the passage of some time, the promise was just forgotten. Like his other pledges, commitments which proved to be bogus, superficial and deceiving, it also proved to be so. Soon the Afghan guests at the oath-taking ceremony fell from sight. Instead, a deal was struck with Karzai, the mayor of Kabul, who ostensibly promised to obey every order and demand of the new American president Obama. Some media sources have reported that even Mr. Karzai went to the extent that he agreed to the creation of a new slot for a new US chief executive for Afghanistan during his recent trip to America. The chief executive will regularly monitor and control all government affairs. The imminently expected appointment of chief executive officer for Afghanistan by the Americans and the approval of Mr. Karzai as a candidate for the next election are indicative of the fact that the Americans are not willing to alleviate the sufferings of the Afghans—though these problems are the outcome of the corruption-ridden administration and mafia-like State of Afghanistan. A stooge with such debasement that he is ready to sign any document concerning occupation and proselytizing without any demur is certainly a nominee that Americans want to keep installed in Kabul. Moreover, there will be a powerful American executive, sitting side by side with Karzai in Kabul whereas Karzai will not have the gut to oppose him. With such conditions and strings attached to his nomination, the Americans will not be so insane to look for another surrogate or invest in another individual. Similarly, the appointment of a new commander for Afghanistan is also a link of the series. It indicates that the previous US strategy has failed to achieve its target while its new strategy is not delivering. Robert Gates says, the appointment of the new commander is part of the military plan. However, in fact, the American military strategy has failed as well as their generals, commanders and politicians (to achieve the expansionist goals as per the pre-planned map). They are facing disgrace and will end up withdrawing from Afghanistan humiliatingly. The Americans did not spare to get underway all tactical plans including the increase in troops, formation of Arbakais and militias and election dramas. But they enlarged their economic burden and met with defeat at the battle field. This is not our claim. All observers assert in the international media that Americans are destined to defeat in Afghanistan militarily and politically. A few months prior to the election campaign in Afghanistan, the American officials and Western media were lambasting Karzai and his administration as being corrupt and incompetent . But now they have come round that there was not a suitable leadership to fill up the gap. Thus, they have turned to Karzai and his notorious and corrupt team once again. They are urging them to run for the president and assume the political leadership of Afghanistan. It is clear that Americans are smarting from a leadership lacuna in Afghanistan which has led to failure and disgrace. Because of this, the Americans have resorted to nominating new envoys and ambassadors. Militarily, The Americans strategy is approaching fiasco. We have witnessed in the past years, the Americans transferred and nominated their commanders. Every commander was bragging about new strategy and experiences but after the passage of time, it dawned upon him that this war was not winnable. The new approach of a new commander and envoy is one of the Roberate Gates pipedreams who made it public for the consumption of mass media but so far no tangible result is seen. He is trying to show to the people of America and his Allies that he feels his responsibility as a minister of defense and wants to save America and NATO from a would-be defeat and disgrace. But with him , the time is finished. All his efforts tantamount to a drowning man who catches at a straw to save himself but is not able to do so. Ganges went to grave with his covetous dream of bringing Afghanistan under his control unfulfilled. The beginning and end of the Britain is too well-known to the Americans. They wanted to impose on the Afghans a surrogate, Shah Shuja, a de facto replica of Karzai but instead, faced a humiliating consequence. The injuries of the former Soviet Union are still fresh . They shored up Babrak Karmal and his cohorts but, the Afghans as per their traditions, gave them a lesson. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan reminds the Americans and their Allies of the past history of Afghanistan that even before Chris Era, the Alexander could not occupy this land of the free people. The Americans should know that they will not achieve the goal by nomination of envoys and commanders; the boasting up of stooges through fake elections; deployment of new troops and bombardment of civilians. Soon or later, they will have to acknowledge their defeat in Afghanistan. But better be to acknowledge it now and try to find a logical exit strategy for the occupation forces. 4 june 2009",2009,06,04,2009-06-04 00:00:00.000,11157

The ambush took place not far from the main U.S. base in Bagram, just north of the capital Kabul. It was the third strike by insurgents in the region in less than a week, part of a surge in violence eight years after the U.S invaded to oust the Taliban regime. Obama made the remarks in Egypt in a speech aimed at healing relations between the United States and Muslims. He said he did not want to establish permanent bases or keep troops in Afghanistan, but that both were currently needed to fight extremists intent on killing as many Americans as they can. ""It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women,"" said Obama, who has ordered 21,000 extra troops to Afghanistan, adding to the around 60,000 foreign soldiers already in the country. Humayun Hamidzada, a spokesman for Afghan President Hamid Karzai, said Obama's statement ""reflected the reality."" ""We are grateful for the support and sacrifice of the U.S. but we would like to stand on our own two feet as quickly as possible,"" Hamidzada said.

Three Americans were killed and another soldier, whose nationality was not released, was injured. Kapisa is considered a stronghold of insurgents loyal to Afghan warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. In other violence, police found the body of candidate for upcoming provincial elections in Wardak province, west of Kabul, said police chief Khial Baz Sherzai. Suspected Taliban insurgents kidnapped the candidate, Yeiya Mulaye Azhar, 11 days ago, he said. Afghans are scheduled to go to the polls on Aug. 20 to elect a president and provincial officials. Militants have urged the country's 30 million people not to vote. A roadside bomb Wednesday killed four farmers as they returned from the fields in southern Kandahar province, said Abuduulah Khan, deputy provincial police chief.

His death would be a major blow to the rebels and a boost for President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed's government, which had tried unsuccessfully to broker peace talks with the 62-year-old cleric. Aweys, whom western security services say is close to al Qaeda, is an influential figure among the insurgents in Somalia, where he has headed various Islamist groups since the 1990s. ""We understand that Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys was brought yesterday to his brother's house opposite the football stadium,"" said the Aweys's family member. ""We were denied access but confirmed there were doctors in the area... The mood looks like he is dead. The whole area is surrounded by gunmen and there is no access,"" he added, of the house close to Mogadishu's football stadium. A pro-government militia said its fighters shot Aweys during battles in Wabho town on Friday, and he died of wounds later. But Aweys's movement, Hizbul Islam, denied that as propaganda. There were also rumors among militia fighters that another rebel leader, Hassan Turki had died In one of the worst flare-ups of the year, 123 people died in fighting for Wabho, mainly on Friday, between the joint forces of al Shabaab insurgents and Aweys's group, and the pro-government moderate Islamist militia Ahla Sunna Waljamaca. An Islamist insurgency since early 2007 -- the latest cycle in 19 years of conflict in Somalia -- has killed around 18,000 civilians and thousands more fighters. It has also drawn foreign jihadists into Somalia, enabled piracy to flourish offshore and unsettled the whole region, with East African neighbors on high security alert.

Aweys says he is alive, vows to continue insurgency 8 Jun 8, 2009 - 2:22:24 PM MOGADISHU, Somalia June 8 (Garowe Online) - A top Somali opposition figure has told a Monday press conference in the capital Mogadishu that he is alive and vowed to continue the insurgency, Radio Garowe reports. Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, the rebel chief of Hizbul Islam faction, rejected reports that he was wounded on June 5 during intense battles in the central Somali region of Galgadud as ""propaganda."" Sheikh Aweys ""I am healthy and there is no injury on my body, as you can see,"" Sheikh Aweys told reporters in Mogadishu. Aweys, 62, vowed that Hizbul Islam fighters will continue the insurgency against the U.N.-endorsed Somali interim government led by his former ally, President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed. ""Me and [President] Sheikh Sharif can meet only when the enemy leaves [Somalia],"" Sheikh Aweys said, while referring to a 4,000-strong African Union peacekeeping force serving in Mogadishu since March 2007. He accused the U.S. government of ""fuelling the war"" in parts of Somalia, where Al Shabaab and Hizbul Islam rebels are fighting to topple the Horn of Africa country's beleaguered interim government. ""Islamic rule supported by the West cannot be a true Islamic government, but it is intended to trick the Somali public,"" said Sheikh Aweys. He did not directly condemn piracy while speaking about Somali pirate attacks off the country’s long coastline, but suggested that piracy was ""created"" as an excuse to ""destroy the Islamic movement"" in Somalia. Al Shabaab and Hizbul Islam rebels outgunned the pro-government Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jamee'a militia in Wabho, a small town in Galgadud region. Mogadishu-based Elman human rights organization reported that 123 people were killed in the single-day battle. Sheikh Aweys is on the U.S. government list of terror suspects, but he has repeatedly denied any links to international terror groups. Source: Garowe Online",2009,06,09,2009-06-09 00:00:00.000,3545

6890,21431,1893,Latest News About The Mujahideen In Somalia,1585,at-taqwa,"NAIROBI ( Sh. M. Network ) - The Kenya government has vowed to intervene in the rapidly declining Somalia crisis. Foreign Affairs Minister Moses Wetang’ula made the remarks after a crisis meeting with envoys from the European Union over the growing control of insurgents, now targeting Somali government officials. Addressing a news conference in his Nairobi office on Friday, Mr Wetang’ula said the meeting had been ordered by President Kibaki following the “security threats to Kenya’s strategic interests.” Although the Foreign Affairs Minister did not divulge the specific measures being taken to end the insurgency, he hinted at possible military intervention. He said the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) was “looking at options” to protect the Somali government from militia attacks. Already airports in militia-controlled regions have been declared ‘no-fly zones’, while the ports have been blockaded. This, Mr Wetang’ula said, is meant to cut off supplies to the insurgents. “It will be most inappropriate and inadvisable to do nothing when our national security and regional stability is threatened,” he said. “We cannot be by-standers in a situation such as this.” Kenya’s stake in the Somali conflict is hinged on the insecurity threat posed by the swelling numbers of refugees into the country. Also, the persistent attacks in the high seas by Somali pirates is a source of concern to a government keen on protecting international trade. However, Mr Wetang’ula dismissed the threats as “not worth our (Kenya’s) comment.” Source: Daily nation",2009,06,19,2009-06-19 00:00:00.000,3545

The Somali president accused al-Qaida of being behind the attack. Witness Mohamed Nur said a small car headed toward the gate of the Medina Hotel in Belet Weyne, then drove into vehicles leaving the hotel and exploded. Information Minister Farhan Ali Mohamud announced the death of National Security Minister Omar Hashi Aden but declined to give any other details. Somalia's president accused al-Qaida of being behind the bombing, which he said also killed a senior Somali diplomat. ""It was an act of terrorism and it is part of the terrorist attack on our people,"" Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed told journalists in the capital. ""Al-Qaida is attacking us."" Experts have expressed fears that foreign Islamic militants could use Somalia as a base for terror in the region. Al-Shabab, an extremist Islamist group in Somalia, is considered by the U.S. State Department to be a terrorist organization with links to al-Qaida. Al-Shabab has denied the links. The United States accuses al-Shabab of harboring al-Qaida-linked terrorists who allegedly blew up U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. The United States has attempted to kill suspected al-Qaida members in Somalia several times with airstrikes. Somalia has not had an effective government for 18 years after warlords overthrew a longtime dictator and plunged the country into anarchy and chaos. The lawlessness has also allowed piracy to thrive off the country's coast, making Somalia the world's worst piracy hotspot. Islamic insurgents have been trying to topple Somalia's weak, Western-backed government for more than two years. There was a surge of violence in May, during which almost 200 people were killed. The U.N. says the conflict has displaced more than 122,000 people. At least 17 people were killed in overnight battles between Islamic insurgents and government forces in Mogadishu, witnesses said Thursday. Information Minister Farhan Ali Mohamed denied the government targeted residential areas, adding government forces were only defending themselves. An insurgent spokesman, Hassan Mahdi, said his side did not attack any government positions but were defending themselves. Mahdi said once the insurgents repulsed the government forces then the government side started shelling residential areas. Neither spokesman gave any casualty figures. Mogadishu does not have any clearly defined battlegrounds and both sides' forces are located close to residential areas.",2009,06,19,2009-06-19 00:00:00.000,3545

Network ) – Harakat Al-shabab Mujahideen court has Thursday carried out double amputations on four men for stealing phones and guns in the Somali capital Mogadishu. They have each had a hand and foot cut off after being convicted by a Sharia court in the capital earlier this week. Hundreds of people, mainly women and children, watched as members of Harakat Al-shabab Muhideen cut off their limbs. The four men reportedly admitted to the robberies. On Monday, the court had said it was too hot for the sentence to be carried out on that day as an amputation in such conditions could lead the accused to bleed to death. shabelle",2009,06,25,2009-06-25 00:00:00.000,3545

7676,2282,1165,GIMF: &quot;Glad Tiding for the Believers and Shaking for the Disbelievers&quot; Second and Final Part of the questionaire with brother Asad al-Jihad2,12,Insurgent,"Assalamu alykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh, The Administration of Al-Firdaws Forums is translating this, it will be put part by part insha allah, here is the first part: Quote: Bismillahi Ar-Rahmani Ar-Rahim, Brother Asad Al-Jihad2 has released his second part of his article, with many answers to many questions directed him. The most important poinst he mentioned are the following: 1- Regarding the Media efforts: He said: ""Our Jihad media harms the enemies so much, till they admitted that the media of Al-Qaeda beat the whole world's media."" ""This great media is the thing that impaired the sleep of the Tawagheet all over the world, despite the fierce aggression made against it"" ""All of those who were pursuing the last events noticed how the media affected the war on Gaza, and how the Media was well exploited to make all Muslims support their brothers in Gaza, and how the media manifested the power of the Mujahideen during that war, and the people of Jihad and their supporters realised that if they just got 1% of this media coverage that was made for Gaza, then the situations would change in many fronts, but Allah destines and do what He wants. Despite all of that, the role of the Jihad Media that convey the real truth is the most effective factor in the area, because it works with noble and sublime principles for the sake of pleasing Allah (swt), and not like the rest of the media means that would inflame people to make them vent their anger, then they numbed them at last"". 2- Regarding the video released by Al-Malaahim Foundation: He said: ""And I will stop here with two matters happened lately which bring bad news to the Tawagheet all over the world, that what is waiting for them is more severe and extreme than what already passed, and it cannot be compared to it. The release made by the blessed Al-Malaahim Foundation of the gathering of the leader brothers (may Allah protect them and grant them success) has shaked the thrones of the Tawagheet of the whole Arabian peninsula, and all the Tawagheet that interefere with the affairs of Muslims. This release needs many contemplations to analyse it, as every word, every sentence, and every guesture in it has big indications. Even the turbans that were worn by each of them indicate a huge event going to happen. That is regardless their strong and extreme statement against the Tawagheet. And I greet the Islamic Ummah for this blessed gathering and this blesed leadership which will restore many glories that were missed by many people, and will return battles that were missed by many brothers to participate in, and it is the time for the youth of the Arabian Peninsula to rise for migration and training and joining those qualified people who were exanorated by the leaders of Jihad, to start the Jihad to purify the land of the two sancuaries from the worshippers of the cross and all of their protectors. They emerged on a video release revealing their faces and names, challenging the enemies becuase of their extreme preperation and readiness for the battle in a form that cannot be imagined by most of people so far, then what would you think about those Mujahideen with them who were not spoken about yet? By Allah, they have great and stout men, and the news is what you see not what you hear. And if you contemplate on their statement and release, you will need to analyse many parts of it, to write some strategies regarding the Arabian peninsula and what is around it after this blessed gathering, but I cannot pass this matter without giving a summary about these lion leaders. - As for the Commander Abu Bassir Nassir Al-Wihishi (May Allah protect him and grant him success); he is one of the closest leaders brothers to Sheikh Usamah bin Laden (May Allah protect him and grant him success). No, he is indeed the secretary of the Sheikh and the most closest bodyguards to him, and Allah (swt) enabled him to escape from the captivity, and he is one of the most wanted persons by the Americans, and our father Sheikh Usamah used to always keep him beside him, and he was with him in Tora Bora, and after the end of the Tora Bora battle, and after the withdrawal of Sheikh Usamah from Tora Bora with the company of the victorious Sheikh Ayman Al-Zawahiri (May Allah protect him and grant him success), there were with him a very few big leaders, one of them was this Sheikh, Abu Bassir Al-Wihishi. And the Father Sheikh Usamah rarely waives his services. So instating him to be the leader of the Al-Qaeda Organization in the Arabian Peninsula, it implies that Sheikh Usamah is planning for a very huge thing, that is why he waived his services for the Arabian Peninsula. - As for the leader Abu Sufyan Al-Azdi (May Allah protect him and grant him success), the fluent orator Sheikh. He went out for Jihad twice, and in each time Allah (swt) destined captivity for him. The first time was before he reached the Jihad land, they returned him to the land of the two sanctuaries, and there they tortured him so extremely, and he was hanged from his hands for long days. And in the second time he was captured and was handed over to the Americans, and they tortured him also in Guantanamo, and it is not hidden what they did to our Muslim brothers there, but this did not dissuade him from Jihad. He is a celver militant. And before he went out for Jihad in the first time, he was one of the guards of the enemy of Allah and His Messenger and the believers, the big traitor: Abdullah Bin Abdil Aziz when he was the crown prince. So he knows very well the enterances and exits of the princes and the chiefs. So let the brothers know how Al-Qaeda can infilterate. And this brother is worthy to write books about him. - As for the leader Abu Hurairah Qassim Ar-Reemi (May Allah protect him and grant him success), he was one of those who were captured and escaped in a mythical story, and he was one of the big military coaches in the camps of Al-Qaeda, and the enemy knows what it means that someone is Mujahid and a coach. Many Mujahideen were trained under his instruction, and he is an expert in wars and battles, and a well known leader. And his whole family is migrant in the Cause of Allah, as his father went out with him and the rest of the family to Afghanistan. May Allah bless them. - As for the leader Abu Al-Haarith Al-Uoofi (May Allah protect him and grant him success), he is one of the intelligent fierce leaders, and let the Al-Qaeda Organization in the Arabian Peninsula joy his presence in it. He did not leave any front without participation. He is a genius in the battlefield, and the friend of leader Khattab and Abu Umar Saif (May Allah have mercy on them). Although he was a young boy when he started his Jihad, the Mujahideen leaders would consult with him due to his intelligence. And when the Zionist crusade campain began against Afghanistan, those four leaders were scatterred. Al-Wihishi was in Tora Bora, and Al-Shihri was in Qandahar, and Al-Rimi was in abul, and Al-Uoofi was in Khost. So, SubhanAllah who assembled them in that blessed gathering after all the atrocities they faced. And if I wanted to speak in details about them (And all of them are close to the father Sheikh Usama Bin Laden and the rest of the big leaders) then I would be distracted from the main points of this dialogue. But I would just like to say that what is coming in the future is delightful for the Ummah of Islam. And just few days ago, and after the announcement of that gathering under one leadership, some of those whom you would be glad to know, joined them. one of them is the man of wars, who has his men with him, Dr. Anjashah. Also one of them is a big student of knowledge who was begged by the Saudi regime to appoint him in a high position in the juridical system, but he kept refusing because he saw them as Tawagheet who are enemies to Islam. And many more other than those whom I do not want to speak about, not even by clues, May Allah grant them victory. And I will tell you a very big and glad tiding, which is delightful to every Muslim, especially the supporters of Jihad. It is a tiding that you love and wait a long time for it to hear, and you will see it insha'Allah in the end of my replies to a noble journalist. So be happy, be happy O Ummah of Islam [To be continued insha'Allah..]",2009,02,18,2009-02-18 00:00:00.000,2004

His daughter is a genuine convert to al-Islaam al-Hamdulillah. As a Muslim, he has all his rights of course, but due to the sinister and deceptive nature of his evil anti-Islamic work, I personally, would never divulge any personal information to him, nor would I associate with him in a social manner outside of the Masjid and teaching him the obligations of the Deen in terms of beliefs and actions of worship. I honestly think, it will be many many years before he would have any credibility in the Ummah. He is not like an ordinary convert to al-Islaam. It was easy in the time of the Sahaabah to know who was genuine convert or not as the munaafiqeen would say or do anything to get out of al-Jihaad, when I see mr Jarvey in the frontlines with the known and trustworthy Mujaahideen, then I kiss his head, but not before..!

8047,23428,1893,Latest News About The Mujahideen In Somalia,923,eli,"[Source: Somalia News-Sunday, 28 June 2009] Somalia’s Federal Government of Somalia (TFG) and Ethiopia are discussing plans to redeploy Ethiopian troops back in the country in order to provide protection to the TFG against Islamist groups who are trying to oust it, sources privy with the two parties told Mareeg online on Sunday. Sources at the Somali embassy in Addis Ababa have confirmed to us that the TFG deputy prime minister, who is also the minister of finance, traveled to Addis Ababa in an unannounced trip and is currently holding talks. Sharif Hasan Sheikh Adan, the deputy prime minister of the TFG, has met senior officials of the Ethiopian military after chairing a recent cabinet meeting in Mogadishu in which ministers in the TFG agreed to seek the deployment of foreign troops, particularly Ethiopian forces, in the country. Mareeg tried making contacts with the offices of the Somali president and prime minister about talks with the Ethiopian military, but both declined to comment on the issue. Spokesmen at both offices said they do not have the permission to discuss the matter. Somalia's embassy in Ethiopia also officially declined to confirm the issue. However, a Somali diplomat at the embassy who refrained from being named confirmed that the TFG and Ethiopian military officials were discussing the deployment of Ethiopian troops in Somalia. The TFG deputy prime minister and Ethiopian military officials have not yet finalized their agreement. On the contrary, the TFG has suggested that once both governments agree on the matter, it will then be tabled before the Federal Somali Parliament which will endorse the deployment of Ethiopian troops in the country. The TFG resorted to the deployment of Ethiopian troops in the country because of the united opposition groups that are planning to overthrow it. Armed groups opposed to the TFG have said they will take stern measures against any foreign force that is deployed in Somalia, adding that they will engage them in clashes. Two year ago, the Ethiopian prime minister, Meles Zenawi, deployed more than 5,000 of his troops in Somalia where they were engaged in fierce fighting by armed groups opposed to the then government. It is not yet known whether the Ethiopian government will go ahead and redeploy its forces in Somalia, although some analysts have suggested that Ethiopia might just sent its forces in areas bordering Somalia and that it might not have the capability to once again redeploy its forces in the (Somali) capital, Mogadishu. Elsewhere, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi today in his office received and held talks with deputy prime minister and finance minister of Transitional Federal Government [TFG] of Somalia, Sharif Hasan. According to a high ranking official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who attended the meeting, the two leaders’ discussion mainly focused on the current general situation in Somalia. The two leaders' discussion mainly centred on how to reverse the current security situation in Somalia and Ethiopia's support to the Somalia’s weak government that is struggling heavy fighting with joint opposition fighters. During the meeting, Prime Minister Meles said that his country wants to assist the transitional government in training and capacity building sectors. Ethiopia and the transitional government of Somalia also reached an agreement to annul the danger posed by Al-Shabab in collaboration with the international community, the foreign affairs official said. After the meeting, the deputy prime minister and finance minister of the Somalia transitional government, Sharif Hasan, said that his country wants to further enhance its bilateral relations with Ethiopia. He also said that his discussion with Prime Minister Meles had focused on the prevailing security problem in his country and on the support Ethiopia wants to give to his country",2009,06,29,2009-06-29 00:00:00.000,3545

8158,2360,1165,GIMF: &quot;Glad Tiding for the Believers and Shaking for the Disbelievers&quot; Second and Final Part of the questionaire with brother Asad al-Jihad2,12,Insurgent,"Quote: Bismillahi Ar-Rahmani Ar-Rahim; He said: In this position I cannot neglect those who responded to the unity call of our father Sheikh Usamah (may Allah protect him and grant him success), and they are many Jihadi individuals and corpses. But for me, I see that the most important people who responded to his call, and who I consider their gathering the most dangerous one, which caused an ""earthquake"" in the Arabian Peninsula, is the gathering of the brothers under one leadership in ""The Base of Jihad Organization In The Arabian Peninsula"". This gathering that made the enemy of Allah and His Messenger and the believers: Nayif Bin Abdul-Aziz cry and not sleep at night. As he kept contacting the brothers after they vanished from their jail, which they used to name: ""Rest House"", begging and asking them not to do any action or they would go back to jail. And he presented his offers to them, which were high status, money, palaces, cars, and all that they want. And the brother were just showing their conviction of his offers till they finish their preperations for migration. Before one day of their egress, the enemy of Allah: Muhammad bin Nayif, contacted them and he repeated the offers of his father and ""more"", but they told him in reply that would remind people of the General Leader Abdul-Aziz Al-Miqrin, Sheikh Yusuf Al-Eyeeri and Sheikh Abdullah Ar-Rashood, May Allah have mercy on them. They told him replies full of dignity. Then the traitor Muhammad bin Nayif demanded from all his intelligence to fetch them, and the news spread like fire spreads in fields of dry plants, and Nayif bin Abdul-Aziz became very shocked by this, which forced him to postpone his travel to Tunisia where he was going for a hunting trip, untill he learns the destination of the four brothers. Muhammad Bin Nayif could no longer sleep at night, (and this is assured information from our trustworthy sources) as his movements were well known to the Mujahideen, and his ten dwellings which he keeps visiting are also all known to the Mujahideen, including their entrances and their exits, making it possible for the Mujahideen to reach him and his father and have revenge on them But after they demean them with Jihadi operations, by the Help of Allah, the Most Powerful, and after they let their American and western masters demean him as well, after they [i.e. the Mujahideen] harm them with what they are planning for, with the Will of Allah, the Most Exalted. The gathering of the brothers in the Arabian Peninsula under the united leadership of Abu Bassir Al-Wihishy (May Allah protect him and grant him success) means so much, and this is in response to the request of the father Sheikh Osama Bin Laden (May Allah protect him and grant him success) to unite in the year of unity. And a response to him also when he pointed in his last address to open new fronts in the war against the Zionist crusade. And let the readers be aware how they send the messages to the father, Sheikh Osama Bin Laden (May Allah protect him and grant him success) and to the wise Sheikh Ayman Az-Zawahiri (May Allah protect him), as those are the ones whom they love, like the rest of Mujahideen all over the world, and they know and respect his status, listen to him and obey him for the Pleasure of Allah (Swt). And I say only one statement to those who watch and pursue, and I will not add anything else: You will see from the Al-Qaeda Organization in the Arabian Peninsula, by the Will of the Almighty One, what will change the the Arabian Peninsula and the map that was drawn by the Sykes Pico agreement.

And I shall speak about this topic in details later"" - ""As for the rockets fired from the south of Lebanon, then surely they were not fired by the faction of Satan [i.e. the so-called Hizbullah]. But indeed the firing of the Jihadi rockets exposed the treachery of the Satan's faction and its leader; the enemy of Allah and His messenger, his Sahabah [i.e companions] and his family members: Hassan Nasrullah, when he did not fire anything, not even a ""sound bomb"" against the Jews during the war on Gaza."" - ""As for our intelligence sources in the agent countries, then know that by the grace of Allah, we have high-level infiltrations in all these countries, and we only reveal a little of what we know, to protect our sources and for the sake of tactic and planning, as well as maneuvers. We even have people who supply us with secret information from the American authorities, and I mention also that lately we could successfully get information sources from the American soldiers themselves. As for the countries of Arabs and Muslims, the matter is much easier, and praise be to Allah. You already watched some visual scenes in one of the releases of Al-Furqan Media Foundation, that show an assemblage of the biggest military leaders in the agent Iraqi army, with the biggest American authorities , and they were complaining of the power of the Islamic state. This alone is enough for you to realize the power of our intelligence system. And I add : you all watched some visual scenes in a release of As-Sahaab Foundation, where the American investigators were interrogating the captives. There is in it visual excerpts about what the Libyan consul spoke of, about his mad master's treachery and more. And these scenes were some materials, the Mujahideen thought it would be good to reveal to the public rather than hiding them, so consider what has not been revealed? And that was with voice and imagery, so what do you think about the content of evidence of media less than this, (i.e. only voice)? We indeed have sources very close to the presidents themselves, and their assistants. From ministers, authoritatives, sons, daughters, to their wives. Also Al-Qaeda entered the hearts of people in a way that the Tawagheet cannot imagine, and we just seek help in our works through silence. Just to prove the strength of our intelligence in those countries, I will speak about what happened to the steadfast Sheikh Shakir Al-Abssi (May Allah relieve his calamity) in particular. What I will mention is not known by the closest persons to the traitor Syrian regime. Just to make you relax with the Al-Qaeda organization specifically, and the Mujahideen in general, and to let the enemies of Islam in the Zionist crusade know, what it means to say: ""Now the war has been ignited"""" [To be continued insha'Allah..] May Allah reward the brothers who translated this",2009,02,21,2009-02-21 00:00:00.000,2004

The report adds, Mujahideen set fire to two Serfs including 5 other vehicles fraught with logistic items. In a surprise ambush, the Mujahideen killed six guards of the convoy bedsides destroying the vehicles. Mujahideen also took drivers of the vehicles to their center for further investigation in this regards --------------------------------------------------------- A Mujahideen Assassinate a Campaign Commander in Khust Saturday, 04 July 2009 18:27 Z. Mujahid Mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan stationed in Khust province assassinated a commander of a private militia company named Gwad during an ambush in Lakanu. The private militia company is located in Dabga area, in the center of the Khust province. Americans have created such private militia companies all over Afghanistan, working for the US troops on contract basis. Usually they include former unscrupulous gunmen who are involved in raping and kidnapping of people. The report adds, Mujahideen have captured A-K 47 gun and a set of wireless belonging to the commander. --------------------------- Tremendous losses caused to the Enemy Sunday, 05 July 2009 10:42 Z. Mujahid Mujahideen of the Islamic emirate of Afghanistan have shot down 4 helicopters of the enemy in the past 24 hours with anti-aircraft guns. This is one of the first times that the enemy loses 4 helicopters in one go. Mujahideen shot a military helicopter in Tagab district of Kapissa province during armed confrontation with the invading forces while Mujahideen destroyed another helicopter in Gramser district of Helmand province. American forces based in Helmand have launched attacks against the areas liberated by Mujahideen. However, the Mujahideen, using tip-and-run tactics, have sustained great losses on the enemy including material and life casualties. Similarly, Mujahideen downed an enemy helicopter by shots from 82mm howitzer while Mujahideen hit another helicopter with Z-K-1 anti-aircraft gun. The invading enemy usually does not unveil their losses. They ascribe such losses to technical faults in the helicopters. But with all the military power that the enemy have, they are not able to put down the resistance of the Mujahideen but are facing stiff resistance from Mujahideen who have made the Afghan land a swamp for the invaders. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Mujahideen Pound Herat Airport Sunday, 05 July 2009 11:12 Q Y Ahmadi Mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan pounded the runway of Herat province airport last night at 11.30 o’clock.

The enemy responded by bombing the adjacent areas but no casualty sustained to the Mujahideen. Herat is bordering on Iran in the west of the country. The famous Shindand airport is located near the Herat city, where US troops are stationed. In view of the strained relation between Tehran and Washington, Iran suspects US may use Shindand against Iran, if relations further aggravate between the two countries. ---------------------------------- Mujahideen Killed Romanian Soldiers Sunday, 05 July 2009 13:54 Q.Y.Ahmadi ( Zabul , 5.7.09) The Mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan based in Zabul province blasted a mine in Tarang area, in the vicinity of Qalat, the provincial center, killing six Romanian soldiers on the spot.

The aircraft had major difficulties taking off from a base in Zabul, in the troubled country's south, on Monday. Two other Canadians were wounded. The Briton was from 22 Engineer Regiment, Royal Engineers, the Ministry of Defence said. Next of kin have been informed. His death takes the number of UK troops killed in Afghanistan since 2001 to 175. ""An airwing flight safety investigation is under way and it has determined that the crash did not occur as a result of enemy fire,"" Nato spokesman Major Luc Gaudet said. The helicopter which crashed was a Griffon, which was at an American forward operating base in Zabul, 50 miles north east of Kandahar. The Canadians who died were named by media as Master Corporal Pat Audet and Corporal Martin Joannette. The death of the British soldier means six members of the UK force in Afghanistan have died in less than a week. On Monday hundreds of people turned out to pay their respects as the bodies of two of the men - including the highest ranking Army officer to die on operations since the Falklands War in 1982 - were returned to the UK. Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Thorneloe, 39, the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, and Trooper Joshua Hammond, 18, of 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, died in a blast near Lashkar Gah in Helmand on Wednesday. Lance Corporal David Dennis, 29, of the Light Dragoons, and Private Robert Laws, 18, of 2nd Battalion the Mercian Regiment, died in Helmand on Saturday. Another UK serviceman, who has not yet been named but whose next of kin have been informed, died on Sunday. Seven American troops were killed on Monday, making it one of the deadliest for foreign troops in Afghanistan since the Taliban was ousted in 2001. The helicopter crash comes after thousands of US Marines and hundreds of other Nato troops, as well as Afghan forces, launched an operation to wrest control of several districts in Helmand from Taliban control. The ongoing offensive is the biggest US Marine operation since one in Iraq in 2004. It is part of US President Barack Obama's increased military effort for the troubled country. The aim of the operation is to establish secure conditions for August 20 presidential and provincial council polls. skynews.com",2009,07,08,2009-07-08 00:00:00.000,11157

But before the comprehensive war, there will be severe strikes between us and the Jews, as I will clarify soon, Allah-Willing."" ""I give you glad tidings that huge operations are going to occur soon, by the Will of Allah. and the enemies will not expect from where Allah will strike them, and we ask Allah from His excessive boon"" ""After Allah (swt) saved Sheikh Abu Hussain, Shakir Al-Abssi (may Allah protect him and relieve his calamity) from the mythical battle of Nahr Al-Baarid, that was rare to happen in history, he withdrew to Ain Al-Hilwah camp. Syria began to search for him through its agents, to make him a ""card"" to be be used in its coming goals and plans. It carried this out by the help of its agents that were spread amongst the brothers led by ""Hashim Minqarah"", and whose role was activated to use him, after he was apparently neutralized for a period of time. And because he had influence among the youths there, he could know the place of Sheikh Shakir. Among the difficult situations that surrounded Sheikh Shakir, the cutting of his connections, the scattering of the brothers for the sake of withdrawal, and with the existence of huge dangers and infiltrations with various types of enemies, all gathered at the same time against the brothers in Fateh Al-Islam group, they could deceive Sheikh Shakir in these circumstances, and pull him to Syria in secret through a disguised or recruited spy, who worked for the sake of money and other reasons So he [i.e. the spy] promised Sheikh Shakir to be guided to the Islamic State of Iraq, and the Sheikh believed this trick, because he was not aware of the treachery of this spy, and because of his difficult circumstances. So when he arrived in Syria, the Syrian intelligence put him under high censorship without his awareness, and they knew that he has no relationship with Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State of Iraq. But they were seeking to make any connection between the group of Fateh Al-Islam and Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State, hoping that one of the conductors of Al-Qaeda would contact or reach him. The spy was promising Sheikh Shakir that he would take him to one of the leaders of the Islamic state. When more time passed, and when they could not find any connection between him and Al-Qaeda or the Islamic state, they felt they ought to arrest him, before he would discover the plot made against him, as the delay would raise his doubt then impair their big conspiracy, of which I will clarify soon"" ""The enemy of Allah, His messenger, and the believers: Bashaar bin Hafidh, ordered his dogs to capture Sheikh Shakir alive, and this order was issued from the republican palace, may Allah destroy it over his head. And Bashaar was conducting with his intelligence system a dangerous and big plan, to exploit the captivity of Sheikh Shakir, of which I will speak about later."" ""Sheikh Shakir is now considered by the Syrian regime: the most important prisoner in Syria. And I say: What has Syria to do with Sheikh Shakir? And why does it open a front [with the Mujahideen] that it is not in need of? Did it not find other than the people of truth to trade with its masters and sacrifice them? What did the brothers do to get Syria to be a furious enemy to them? Are they not [i.e. the Mujahideen] the enemies of America and the Jews? So let it leave them alone if it is honest in its enmity to Jews and Americans. But no, how can the one whose flesh was germinated on the filth of evil be other than a traitor? After the arrest of Sheikh Shakir, he was taken as a prisoner that bears only a ""number"", which means that his prison keepers do not recognize him, they only recognize him with a number. And from a prison to another they change his number so as to totally hide the place of his captivity."" [To be continued insha'Allah..]",2009,02,25,2009-02-25 00:00:00.000,2004

He also wanted to blackmail France, and wanted to infiltrate the Islamic State of Iraq and other Jihadi groups (as you will see). And he wanted to link the brothers of Fateh Al-Islam with the party of criminal Sa'd Al-Hariry. He also wanted (and this was the most important aspect for him) to take advantage of this card to blow up the preparations for the ""international court"" and change its course in the case of investigating the assassination of Rafeeq Al-Hariry, and distance its ghost from the Al-Asad family. In the beginning of the arrest they offered such huge temptations to Sheikh Shakir, but he rejected them and was firm like the mountains, so he was tortured harshly, but this just increased his steadfastness. May Allah bless the Conqueror of the cross and the knight of the land of Shaam. So he implemented a lofty statement said by the knowledgable Sheikh Abu Al-Fadl Al-Hadooshi (a scholar from morocco -May Allah break his fetters-): ""We entered the jail as lions, and we will remain lions"". May Allah relieve their calamities and confirm them in the truth. They wanted Sheikh Shakir to falsely admit of two things personally, but these things are not the same as the original goals they seek to achieve through arresting him. The first thing: They wanted him to admit that he had a relationship with the Future party, the agent of crusaders and Tawagheet. And that Fateh Al-Islam was getting support from them and from Sa'd Al-Hariry, so that Fateh Al-Islam would be dropped from Ahlu As-Sunnah and the Jihadi movements when it looked like they were loyal to the Future party, thereforel strengthening the faction of Satan (i.e. so called Hizbullah) which is really the opposite to what Fateh Al-Islam is. But Sheikh Shakir denied all of that and Allah (swt), the Most Exalted, confirmed him."" - ""And the second thing they wanted from him is to evince ""publicly"" that Fateh Al-Islam has an organizational relationship with Al-Qaeda, and this will happen through linking them to the Islamic State of Iraq, so appear like Syria is helping America to exterminate Al-Qaeda , and it indeed did everything to stand alongside with America, to give this ""present"" to the incoming president of America. When they arrested him, they did not know who would be the incoming president of America, although I and everyone knew it was just a play, and they wanted to lift the pressures of the international court from Bashaar bin Hafidh after sacrificing him (i.e. Sheikh Shakir) to them. And I say: Sheikh Shakir had no organizational relationship , neither with Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State of Iraq. Although it is an honour for the Mujahideen in every front to have Sheikh Shakir among them, but let me say that if they show him (on TV) after being tortured, and he admits of a relationship with Al-Qaeda, then know it is because of the torture he endured. And in the answers of the victorious Sheikh Ayman Az-Zawahiri (May Allah protect him and grant him success) in the famous interview (and this was before the arrest of Sheikh Shakir),there were refutations on all their claims, being that there is no relationship between Al-Qaeda and them except the Islamic relationship that gathers Al-Qaeda and the Muslim Ummah all over the world. After that , they arrested many of his relatives to blackmail him, and they tortured them, but he was patient and seeking the rewards from Allah. The most significant thing is that they wanted through him, to distance the ghost of the international court from the criminal Bashaar bin Hafidh, and the Sheikh would be just a scapegoat. Sheikh Shakir did not have any important information that would benefit the intelligence of Syria, except some information about how he escaped from Nahr Al-Baarid,and joining his brothers afterward. The same thing also happened with the brothers whom were arrested with him and tortured severely, may Allah relieve their calamity and revenge on their persecutors."" may allah reward the brothers.",2009,02,25,2009-02-25 00:00:00.000,2004

But if they chose to fight, then I say to the traitors of Syria and those behind them of the Arab Tawagheet and Zionist cursaders: You were small and you will remain small. You will move from a defeat to something more direr and if the country of Syria does not remain stable (even if it appears so outwardly) then the whole region will be on a volcano crater. Know this very well, and do not play with fire and challenge those whom you cannot stand fighting against. And know that the ones who have all this information about Syria are NOT unable to perform shocking strikes into the depth of Syria, and in the other countries of the world, in ""cartilages"" that cannot be expected by the Tawagheet. And the information we own about all countries is not less than already mentioned about Syria. So, O Tawagheet of Syria, your last fortifications that you made around the embassy of America, Russia and Iran, and around the main and secondary security departments, will not benefit you. It will not help you to install and spread security cameras in Damascus and other cities. as we know that you are preparing yourselves to encounter those whom you know very well, and what they did with the largest empire in history, namely your American masters, and those who assist them, when they were at the height of their glory. And you know that we founded, by the Grace of Allah alone, an Islamic state in Iraq out of nothing, and the all countries of the world led by America were against us at the height of their glory, and the Islamic state of Iraq came to light out of a country that was ruling by Baath. What you are going to do against the bearers of the true creed in Syria, Lebanon and the Islamic state of Iraq, you must first think repeatedly and excessively about your reign that is going to collapse [if this encounter occurs]. Know that our strength is not now the same as it was 7 years ago, and we have won, by the Might of Allah and His Support for us. Our power has increased and the people who distinguish between the truth and falsehood increased, and in Syria there are heroic men that are honest in wars and fight like a solid structure for the sake of standing up for their faith and their Prophet (saas). And the Muwahhideen in Syria have had practice and experiences in the fronts of Jihad. The night of tyrants has lasted long in Syria, and people are looking for freedom, might, and dignity; and the implementation is what you will witness and not just hear about, O you new slaves of Americans and Jews. I ask Allah (swt) to break the captivity of the Conqueror of the cross, the Conqueror of its Tawagheet slaves, and the Knight of the countries of Shaam: Abu Hussain, Shakir Al-Abssi, and his family and those with him, and consolidate their hearts and accept their murdered, as martyrs.

The most important poinst he mentioned are the following: 1- Regarding the Media efforts: He said: ""Our Jihad media harms the enemies so much, till they admitted that the media of Al-Qaeda beat the whole world's media."" ""This great media is the thing that impaired the sleep of the Tawagheet all over the world, despite the fierce aggression made against it"" ""All of those who were pursuing the last events noticed how the media affected the war on Gaza, and how the Media was well exploited to make all Muslims support their brothers in Gaza, and how the media manifested the power of the Mujahideen during that war, and the people of Jihad and their supporters realised that if they just got 1% of this media coverage that was made for Gaza, then the situations would change in many fronts, but Allah destines and do what He wants. Despite all of that, the role of the Jihad Media that convey the real truth is the most effective factor in the area, because it works with noble and sublime principles for the sake of pleasing Allah (swt), and not like the rest of the media means that would inflame people to make them vent their anger, then they numbed them at last"". 2- Regarding the video released by Al-Malaahim Foundation: He said: ""And I will stop here with two matters happened lately which bring bad news to the Tawagheet all over the world, that what is waiting for them is more severe and extreme than what already passed, and it cannot be compared to it. The release made by the blessed Al-Malaahim Foundation of the gathering of the leader brothers (may Allah protect them and grant them success) has shaked the thrones of the Tawagheet of the whole Arabian peninsula, and all the Tawagheet that interefere with the affairs of Muslims. This release needs many contemplations to analyse it, as every word, every sentence, and every guesture in it has big indications. Even the turbans that were worn by each of them indicate a huge event going to happen. That is regardless their strong and extreme statement against the Tawagheet. And I greet the Islamic Ummah for this blessed gathering and this blesed leadership which will restore many glories that were missed by many people, and will return battles that were missed by many brothers to participate in, and it is the time for the youth of the Arabian Peninsula to rise for migration and training and joining those qualified people who were exanorated by the leaders of Jihad, to start the Jihad to purify the land of the two sancuaries from the worshippers of the cross and all of their protectors. They emerged on a video release revealing their faces and names, challenging the enemies becuase of their extreme preperation and readiness for the battle in a form that cannot be imagined by most of people so far, then what would you think about those Mujahideen with them who were not spoken about yet? By Allah, they have great and stout men, and the news is what you see not what you hear. And if you contemplate on their statement and release, you will need to analyse many parts of it, to write some strategies regarding the Arabian peninsula and what is around it after this blessed gathering, but I cannot pass this matter without giving a summary about these lion leaders. - As for the Commander Abu Bassir Nassir Al-Wihishi (May Allah protect him and grant him success); he is one of the closest leaders brothers to Sheikh Usamah bin Laden (May Allah protect him and grant him success). No, he is indeed the secretary of the Sheikh and the most closest bodyguards to him, and Allah (swt) enabled him to escape from the captivity, and he is one of the most wanted persons by the Americans, and our father Sheikh Usamah used to always keep him beside him, and he was with him in Tora Bora, and after the end of the Tora Bora battle, and after the withdrawal of Sheikh Usamah from Tora Bora with the company of the victorious Sheikh Ayman Al-Zawahiri (May Allah protect him and grant him success), there were with him a very few big leaders, one of them was this Sheikh, Abu Bassir Al-Wihishi. And the Father Sheikh Usamah rarely waives his services. So instating him to be the leader of the Al-Qaeda Organization in the Arabian Peninsula, it implies that Sheikh Usamah is planning for a very huge thing, that is why he waived his services for the Arabian Peninsula. - As for the leader Abu Sufyan Al-Azdi (May Allah protect him and grant him success), the fluent orator Sheikh. He went out for Jihad twice, and in each time Allah (swt) destined captivity for him. The first time was before he reached the Jihad land, they returned him to the land of the two sanctuaries, and there they tortured him so extremely, and he was hanged from his hands for long days. And in the second time he was captured and was handed over to the Americans, and they tortured him also in Guantanamo, and it is not hidden what they did to our Muslim brothers there, but this did not dissuade him from Jihad. He is a celver militant. And before he went out for Jihad in the first time, he was one of the guards of the enemy of Allah and His Messenger and the believers, the big traitor: Abdullah Bin Abdil Aziz when he was the crown prince. So he knows very well the enterances and exits of the princes and the chiefs. So let the brothers know how Al-Qaeda can infilterate. And this brother is worthy to write books about him. - As for the leader Abu Hurairah Qassim Ar-Reemi (May Allah protect him and grant him success), he was one of those who were captured and escaped in a mythical story, and he was one of the big military coaches in the camps of Al-Qaeda, and the enemy knows what it means that someone is Mujahid and a coach. Many Mujahideen were trained under his instruction, and he is an expert in wars and battles, and a well known leader. And his whole family is migrant in the Cause of Allah, as his father went out with him and the rest of the family to Afghanistan. May Allah bless them. - As for the leader Abu Al-Haarith Al-Uoofi (May Allah protect him and grant him success), he is one of the intelligent fierce leaders, and let the Al-Qaeda Organization in the Arabian Peninsula joy his presence in it. He did not leave any front without participation. He is a genius in the battlefield, and the friend of leader Khattab and Abu Umar Saif (May Allah have mercy on them). Although he was a young boy when he started his Jihad, the Mujahideen leaders would consult with him due to his intelligence. And when the Zionist crusade campain began against Afghanistan, those four leaders were scatterred. Al-Wihishi was in Tora Bora, and Al-Shihri was in Qandahar, and Al-Rimi was in abul, and Al-Uoofi was in Khost. So, SubhanAllah who assembled them in that blessed gathering after all the atrocities they faced. And if I wanted to speak in details about them (And all of them are close to the father Sheikh Usama Bin Laden and the rest of the big leaders) then I would be distracted from the main points of this dialogue. But I would just like to say that what is coming in the future is delightful for the Ummah of Islam. And just few days ago, and after the announcement of that gathering under one leadership, some of those whom you would be glad to know, joined them. one of them is the man of wars, who has his men with him, Dr. Anjashah. Also one of them is a big student of knowledge who was begged by the Saudi regime to appoint him in a high position in the juridical system, but he kept refusing because he saw them as Tawagheet who are enemies to Islam. And many more other than those whom I do not want to speak about, not even by clues, May Allah grant them victory. And I will tell you a very big and glad tiding, which is delightful to every Muslim, especially the supporters of Jihad. It is a tiding that you love and wait a long time for it to hear, and you will see it insha'Allah in the end of my replies to a noble journalist. So be happy, be happy O Ummah of Islam [To be continued insha'Allah..] remaining inshaAllah soon",2009,02,26,2009-02-26 00:00:00.000,2004

But for me, I see that the most important people who responded to his call, and who I consider their gathering the most dangerous one, which caused an ""earthquake"" in the Arabian Peninsula, is the gathering of the brothers under one leadership in ""The Base of Jihad Organization In The Arabian Peninsula"". This gathering that made the enemy of Allah and His Messenger and the believers: Nayif Bin Abdul-Aziz cry and not sleep at night. As he kept contacting the brothers after they vanished from their jail, which they used to name: ""Rest House"", begging and asking them not to do any action or they would go back to jail. And he presented his offers to them, which were high status, money, palaces, cars, and all that they want. And the brother were just showing their conviction of his offers till they finish their preperations for migration. Before one day of their egress, the enemy of Allah: Muhammad bin Nayif, contacted them and he repeated the offers of his father and ""more"", but they told him in reply that would remind people of the General Leader Abdul-Aziz Al-Miqrin, Sheikh Yusuf Al-Eyeeri and Sheikh Abdullah Ar-Rashood, May Allah have mercy on them. They told him replies full of dignity. Then the traitor Muhammad bin Nayif demanded from all his intelligence to fetch them, and the news spread like fire spreads in fields of dry plants, and Nayif bin Abdul-Aziz became very shocked by this, which forced him to postpone his travel to Tunisia where he was going for a hunting trip, untill he learns the destination of the four brothers. Muhammad Bin Nayif could no longer sleep at night, (and this is assured information from our trustworthy sources) as his movements were well known to the Mujahideen, and his ten dwellings which he keeps visiting are also all known to the Mujahideen, including their entrances and their exits, making it possible for the Mujahideen to reach him and his father and have revenge on them But after they demean them with Jihadi operations, by the Help of Allah, the Most Powerful, and after they let their American and western masters demean him as well, after they [i.e. the Mujahideen] harm them with what they are planning for, with the Will of Allah, the Most Exalted. The gathering of the brothers in the Arabian Peninsula under the united leadership of Abu Bassir Al-Wihishy (May Allah protect him and grant him success) means so much, and this is in response to the request of the father Sheikh Osama Bin Laden (May Allah protect him and grant him success) to unite in the year of unity. And a response to him also when he pointed in his last address to open new fronts in the war against the Zionist crusade. And let the readers be aware how they send the messages to the father, Sheikh Osama Bin Laden (May Allah protect him and grant him success) and to the wise Sheikh Ayman Az-Zawahiri (May Allah protect him), as those are the ones whom they love, like the rest of Mujahideen all over the world, and they know and respect his status, listen to him and obey him for the Pleasure of Allah (Swt). And I say only one statement to those who watch and pursue, and I will not add anything else: You will see from the Al-Qaeda Organization in the Arabian Peninsula, by the Will of the Almighty One, what will change the the Arabian Peninsula and the map that was drawn by the Sykes Pico agreement. O land of the Revelation have patience, as now the battle has been ignited. [To be continued insha'Allah..] Remaining InshaAllah soon",2009,02,26,2009-02-26 00:00:00.000,2004

As I am writing these words, the Sheikh is still a captive in the prison of the enemy of Allah and His Messenger, and the believers: Bashaar Bin Haafidh [i.e. the president of Syria]. And he has been tortured most severely. I ask Allah (swt) to accept from him, raise his rank, and break his captivity. And I shall speak about this topic in details later"" - ""As for the rockets fired from the south of Lebanon, then surely they were not fired by the faction of Satan [i.e. the so-called Hizbullah]. But indeed the firing of the Jihadi rockets exposed the treachery of the Satan's faction and its leader; the enemy of Allah and His messenger, his Sahabah [i.e companions] and his family members: Hassan Nasrullah, when he did not fire anything, not even a ""sound bomb"" against the Jews during the war on Gaza."" - ""As for our intelligence sources in the agent countries, then know that by the grace of Allah, we have high-level infiltrations in all these countries, and we only reveal a little of what we know, to protect our sources and for the sake of tactic and planning, as well as maneuvers. We even have people who supply us with secret information from the American authorities, and I mention also that lately we could successfully get information sources from the American soldiers themselves. As for the countries of Arabs and Muslims, the matter is much easier, and praise be to Allah. You already watched some visual scenes in one of the releases of Al-Furqan Media Foundation, that show an assemblage of the biggest military leaders in the agent Iraqi army, with the biggest American authorities , and they were complaining of the power of the Islamic state. This alone is enough for you to realize the power of our intelligence system. And I add : you all watched some visual scenes in a release of As-Sahaab Foundation, where the American investigators were interrogating the captives. There is in it visual excerpts about what the Libyan consul spoke of, about his mad master's treachery and more. And these scenes were some materials, the Mujahideen thought it would be good to reveal to the public rather than hiding them, so consider what has not been revealed? And that was with voice and imagery, so what do you think about the content of evidence of media less than this, (i.e. only voice)? We indeed have sources very close to the presidents themselves, and their assistants. From ministers, authoritatives, sons, daughters, to their wives. Also Al-Qaeda entered the hearts of people in a way that the Tawagheet cannot imagine, and we just seek help in our works through silence. Just to prove the strength of our intelligence in those countries, I will speak about what happened to the steadfast Sheikh Shakir Al-Abssi (May Allah relieve his calamity) in particular. What I will mention is not known by the closest persons to the traitor Syrian regime. Just to make you relax with the Al-Qaeda organization specifically, and the Mujahideen in general, and to let the enemies of Islam in the Zionist crusade know, what it means to say: ""Now the war has been ignited"""" [To be continued insha'Allah..]",2009,02,26,2009-02-26 00:00:00.000,2004

But before the comprehensive war, there will be severe strikes between us and the Jews, as I will clarify soon, Allah-Willing."" ""I give you glad tidings that huge operations are going to occur soon, by the Will of Allah. and the enemies will not expect from where Allah will strike them, and we ask Allah from His excessive boon"" ""After Allah (swt) saved Sheikh Abu Hussain, Shakir Al-Abssi (may Allah protect him and relieve his calamity) from the mythical battle of Nahr Al-Baarid, that was rare to happen in history, he withdrew to Ain Al-Hilwah camp. Syria began to search for him through its agents, to make him a ""card"" to be be used in its coming goals and plans. It carried this out by the help of its agents that were spread amongst the brothers led by ""Hashim Minqarah"", and whose role was activated to use him, after he was apparently neutralized for a period of time. And because he had influence among the youths there, he could know the place of Sheikh Shakir. Among the difficult situations that surrounded Sheikh Shakir, the cutting of his connections, the scattering of the brothers for the sake of withdrawal, and with the existence of huge dangers and infiltrations with various types of enemies, all gathered at the same time against the brothers in Fateh Al-Islam group, they could deceive Sheikh Shakir in these circumstances, and pull him to Syria in secret through a disguised or recruited spy, who worked for the sake of money and other reasons So he [i.e. the spy] promised Sheikh Shakir to be guided to the Islamic State of Iraq, and the Sheikh believed this trick, because he was not aware of the treachery of this spy, and because of his difficult circumstances. So when he arrived in Syria, the Syrian intelligence put him under high censorship without his awareness, and they knew that he has no relationship with Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State of Iraq. But they were seeking to make any connection between the group of Fateh Al-Islam and Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State, hoping that one of the conductors of Al-Qaeda would contact or reach him. The spy was promising Sheikh Shakir that he would take him to one of the leaders of the Islamic state. When more time passed, and when they could not find any connection between him and Al-Qaeda or the Islamic state, they felt they ought to arrest him, before he would discover the plot made against him, as the delay would raise his doubt then impair their big conspiracy, of which I will clarify soon"" ""The enemy of Allah, His messenger, and the believers: Bashaar bin Hafidh, ordered his dogs to capture Sheikh Shakir alive, and this order was issued from the republican palace, may Allah destroy it over his head. And Bashaar was conducting with his intelligence system a dangerous and big plan, to exploit the captivity of Sheikh Shakir, of which I will speak about later."" ""Sheikh Shakir is now considered by the Syrian regime: the most important prisoner in Syria. And I say: What has Syria to do with Sheikh Shakir? And why does it open a front [with the Mujahideen] that it is not in need of? Did it not find other than the people of truth to trade with its masters and sacrifice them? What did the brothers do to get Syria to be a furious enemy to them? Are they not [i.e. the Mujahideen] the enemies of America and the Jews? So let it leave them alone if it is honest in its enmity to Jews and Americans. But no, how can the one whose flesh was germinated on the filth of evil be other than a traitor? After the arrest of Sheikh Shakir, he was taken as a prisoner that bears only a ""number"", which means that his prison keepers do not recognize him, they only recognize him with a number. And from a prison to another they change his number so as to totally hide the place of his captivity."" [To be continued insha'Allah..] remaining soon inshaAllah.

10573,2730,1165,GIMF: &quot;Glad Tiding for the Believers and Shaking for the Disbelievers&quot; Second and Final Part of the questionaire with brother Asad al-Jihad2,12,Insurgent,"Quote: The conspiracy against the Islamic state: America was about to ""officially"" announce her defeat in Iraq in opposition to the victory of the Islamic State, and more than one leader of Jihad stated this. Even the enemies of Islam confessed that the Islamic State of Iraq in the begining of its establishment was dominating most of the territories of Ahl Al-Sunnah, and it was implementing Sharia in many areas. But the slaves of America in the region, whose illegal regimes were strongly threatened by the victory of the Islamic State, everyone of them began to present a ""project"" to save America from defeat, through a fierce war against the Mujahideen and the Islamic State of Iraq. So they killed many Muslims, Mujahideen and their leaders, and also captured many. Also the honour of many females was violated, all to protect America from defeat; Allah suffices us for everything and He is the most excellent guardian. And everyone of these regimes strove hard to please America by offering the best possible solutions to enjoy her pleasure with them, so by the conduction of Allah, the Most Exalted, every project was in conflict with the other, while they were seeking the pleasure of their Zionist-crusader masters. Their conflicts appeared on the surface; as the Tawagheet of Qatar have their own project for Iraq, and Saudi has its own project, and their contest for power reflected negatively to their relationships, and much of this emerged on Media (as will be soon see). And the reason for the reduction of the insulting phenomenon between Saudi and Qatar on Media in the last years is that the Taghout Nayif bin Abdul-Aziz, and his son Muhammad, both were courting the Tawagheet of Qatar, and this is because he needs Qatar to increase his power in the region, to reach the throne of Saudi (as it will be seen soon). Know that in Saudi itself there are two wings that contest the reign because there is one ""vacancy"" for one of them, so everyone of those slaves is striving hard to please the Americans with what all what he can, to gain their pleasure and win this ""vacancy"". As with the sickness of Taghout Sultan Bin Abdul-Aziz, the contest increased between the wing of Taghout Nayif bin Abdul-Aziz and his son Muhammad on one side, and the wing of Taghout Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz on the other side. So they were competing in pleasing their American lords, each of them wanting to win the throne of Sultan Bin Abdul-Aziz, and certainly no one will sit on this throne except the one whom America is pleased with, and who is more the agent and treacherous than the other. As for Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz, he is the owner of the ""official"" project for Iraq, and the owner of the ""Awakening"" project which is based on tribalism to eliminate the Islamic State of Iraq. He brought many of the tribes chiefs to Riyadh, and he personally met with them and granted them vast amounts of money to buy their conscience , and fight under his commandment for the sake of reaching the reigning throne. His project was very successful at the begining, but later it weakened a great deal by the Grace of Allah, the Most Exalted, then the Jihad of the Islamic State of Iraq, and his project did not conclude yet. So in opposition to this project, another one emerged to compete for the pleasure of America, This one is the most dangerous, and who bear its responsibility are the treacherous Tawagheet of Al-Thani in Qatar, and the tyrant Nayif Bin Abdul-Aziz and his son Muhammad who joined them. Their project is to please America by eliminating the Islamic State of Iraq by initially founding ""The Front of Jihad And Reform"" then ""The Political Council of the Iraqi Resistance"", and then it expanded to include every group and corps that bears the name ""Islamic"", from those whom they could persuade to join them, and they made their so-called Mujahideen to be like mercenary groups and carry out the demands of America's slaves for the sake of gaining the biggest power and pleasing the Americans. No one was safe from the harm of these groups, except those whom Allah (the Most Exalted) saved, and they are very few (as will be seen soon). And the first practical step they made against the project of Salman is to establish the Istanbul Conference, and ridiculously, in Turkey again!! They revealed the real face of the enemy of Allah ""Ibrahim Ash-Shummari"", and they employed along with them the scholars of Surooriyyah, may Allah make their conspiracy a dagger in their hearts. So now in reality, the tyrant Nayif Bin Abdul-Aziz (May Allah curse him) is closer to the reign than is the tyrant Salman bin Abdul-Aziz (May Allah curse him), because Nayif and his son's wickedness is somehow sly, because it exploits the inclination of people towards Islam, so they employed the Surooriyyah scholars, and add to this their strong alliance with Al-Thani (i.e. the rulers of Qatar). As for Salman, he is the farthest from the vacant throne, because despite his wickedness, he has some stupidity that is known by everyone who associates with him. As for the tyrant Muhammad Bin Nayif, who is prepared by his father to be the ""king"" in the second generation after the sons of Abdul-Aziz, he is the one with whom the Americans are pleased, because he (as the Americans think) is the one who is able to protect the country from within, and protect the oil refineries and other American interests. He is (as they think) the one who is able to curb the Al-Qaeda Organization [[Note that Al-Qaeda released a statement about its unity under one strong and exonerated leadership, under the banner of The Al-Qaeda Organization Of The Arabian Peninsula; which shook the mainstays of the plots of Nayif and his son]]. And Muhammad Bin Nayif in the sight of his masters, is the one who is able to spread his power in the other countries, and this is how the Americans describe him in their reports and studies, and as can be observed through pursuing what is happening in reality. As Qatar, Nayif and his son use the religion and hypocrisy (which is the most extreme element in their nature), and have lots of money to support those brigades and groups, as well as the ""Al-Jazeerah channel"" (and I said in part one of this essay, that the whole power of Qatar is based on two things: Al-Jazeerah channel and money). So the channel used to (and it still does) interview the enemy of Allah ""Ibrahim Ash-Shummari"", the lying spokesman of their front, and they have no shame to repeat interviewing him till this present day to fulfil their project. [To be continued insha'Allah..]",2009,03,01,2009-03-01 00:00:00.000,2004

10717,2754,1165,"GIMF: ""Glad Tiding for the Believers and Shaking for the Disbelievers"" Second and Final Part of the questionaire with brother Asad al-Jihad2",12,Insurgent,"assalamu alykum, Quote: The role of the so-called ""Sheikh"" Hamid Al-Ali in fighting the Islamic State: Hamid Al-Ali (who served the alliance of Al-Thani and Nayif) met with the chiefs of the so-called ""Islamic Army"" in Kuwait many times!! Then at a specific time he maligned and slandered the Islamic State and demanded its dismantling. Then directly a statement released by the so-called ""Islamic Army"" with slanders, insults, maligning and lies. So he was just exchanging the roles with them, then he repeated and maintained his maligning against the Islamic State and everyone who supports it. Afterwards he personally met with the chiefs of the so-called Islamic Army and the leaders of the ""resistance"" corpses that constructed ""The Front of Jihad and Reform"" in Qatar. And as far as I remember, the statement ""Safr Al-Haqiqah"" (i.e. the chapter of the truth) that belongs to Ansar Al-Islam group already pointed to their meeting in Qatar also, and the announcement of ""The Front of Jihad and Reform"" was made in the country of Qatar!! Later he personally met with them, also in Qatar, and then they announced the establishment of the so-called: ""The political council of the Iraqi Resistance"". After a few days of this announcement (according to what I remember) the Al-Jazeera channel only welcomed him, after she (i.e. Al-Jazeera) became pleased with him, and after he joined the confederacy and declared his blessing to this front. So let no naive person think that he was deceived, but rather that he knows exactly what he is doing The treachery of the so-called Islamic Army became clear to everyone, and maybe also to the detainees of Guantanamo who are still imprisoned. And everyone now, whether they are old or young, knows that the Islamic Army is a traitor and fights the Mujahideen. I even corresponded previously with some brothers to write some pieces of advice to Hamid Al-Ali, and I reminded them to be soft in advising him (I did not speak about this before, so if the advising brothers wish, they can declare this publicly to let people know that I was trying my best to reconcile, and I did not dare to speak about him until he rejected the truth, so I became the last one who spoke about him) He was advised by them in the best possible way, and also other leaders, scholars and brothers advised him in the days in which we were thinking good about him. And he engaged the Mujahideen and their leaders with his Fitnah, and with repeated advicee to him, he still declined to yield to the truth, and insisted to remain with the confederacy of Qatar-Nayif. And who returns to the bearings of Hamid Al-Ali after he considers my speech deeply, will realise many things, even in matters other than Iraq. like his bearings regarding Afghanistan, Algeria, Palestine, and lately Somalia. And consider more than this, as a few days ago Hamid Al-Ali emerged to answer all those who advised him and thought good about him, and he praised the traitor so called Islamic Army, after they released their last video of their so-called sniper, after the blessed Al-Adha Eid passed, with poetic verses, such as: Accept my unhidden greeting to you, as you are an Army that follows Islam. So according to Hamid Al-Ali, the traitor Islamic Army is the one who represent the establishment of the Islamic law, and it is the one that really follows it, so does he want us to believe him? And he openly stated his answer to everyone who advised him, and clarified his position and his"" unhidden"" belief (as he said), so as to leave no room for good thinking about him in this matter. Therefore no one can say that he probably kept silent for a while to re-consider his position! He just declared his loyalty later and he made it ""unhidden"", so by doing so, he just slapped all the supporters of the truth. And Hamid Al-Ali with the Islamic army, were slandering the Islamic State of Iraq, and claiming that it has extremism and fanaticism, and more. And now I will tell you why they did this, then subsequently changed their accusations later. They were thinking that a certain brother was the honourable patient Sheikh Abu Umar Al-Baghdadi, the commander of the Islamic State of Iraq, may Allah protect him and grant him success, and he is the one whom they plot against. So they wanted to distort his reputation and malign the whole Islamic state through maligning him, because they thought he was the commander. Then after that brother got arrested, and the news spread that the commander of the Islamic State got arrested, and afterwards an audio statement of the Commander of the Believers in the Islamic State of Iraq, and the noble Sheikh Abu Umar Al-Baghdadi (May Allah protect him and make him a thorn in their throat) was released, they got deeply shocked, and they changed their slanders, accusations and revilement to another slander and fib, which is: ""the commander of the state is unknown, and who supports him is unknown and a ghost or a bat"", due to their extreme frustration. And they kept repeating it till the present day. And I was defending him in the early days of his Fitnah, and trying to appease the anger of our brothers with him, because I would prefer to excuse him and think good about him. So I was requesting from the brothers to advise him, and I defended him in several places on the Internet and outside off the Internet. Not only that, I also wrote one of my articles and put in its title: ""With the pen of Unknown"", and this was after he insulted the supporters of the truth and justice and said they were unknown, then after he came back and repeated his maligning and described the brothers as ghosts and bats. Here I wrote another article and concluded it with : ""With the pen of the ghost bat: Asad Al-Jihad2"".. attempting to appease the anger of the brothers with (about) him, and that he might remember or fear, and then repent. Some brothers were blaming me for attributing such names to myself, and most brothers did not realize the signification behind those names, but today it cannot be endurable. And now we see them discussing the matter of Somalia, and they would praise certain groups that most people never heard about and underestimate The Movement of Youth Mujahideen, which dominate more than two thirds of Somalia, so they directed their Fitnah to Somalia, Allah suffices us for everything and He is the most excellent guardian. The heroic Sheikh Abu Hamzah Al-Muhaajir said that because of the Fatwa of Hamid Al-Ali the honour of believing women was violated, and the monotheists were killed and wounded, and the victory delayed. We will sue him for this and other things before the Lord of Might and Power, the One Who will revenge, the Greatest, He knoweth the traitor of the eyes, and that which the bosoms hide. Deem not that Allah is unaware of what the wicked do. He but giveth them a respite till a day when eyes will stare (in terror). We have confided our cause to Allah, the Most Exalted. And the least that can be done to him is to quarantine him, as Imam Abu Hanifah (ra) said: None is to be quarantined but three: ""The depraved Mufti... etc"". And Imam Malik (ra) narrated from his Sheikh Rabi'ah that he said: ""Some of those who issue Fatwa are worthy of jail more than the thieves"". And this is in the Fatwa with lenience and manipulation in it, so how would it be with declaring war against the Mujahideen and conspiring against them? Yet they claim to support the Mujahideen and trade with this claim? Allah suffices us for everything and He is the most excellent guardian. Almight Allah said [04:141]: الَّذِينَ يَتَرَبَّصُونَ بِكُمْ فَإِن كَانَ لَكُمْ فَتْحٌ مِّنَ اللّهِ قَالُواْ أَلَمْ نَكُن مَّعَكُمْ وَإِن كَانَ لِلْكَافِرِينَ نَصِيبٌ قَالُواْ أَلَمْ نَسْتَحْوِذْ عَلَيْكُمْ وَنَمْنَعْكُم مِّنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ فَاللّهُ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ Those who wait upon occasion in regard to you and, if a victory cometh unto you from Allah, say: Are we not with you? and if the disbelievers meet with a success say: Had we not the mastery of you, and did we not protect you from the believers? Allah will judge between you at the Day of Resurrection. And Al-Thani and Nayif, especially his son Muhammd Bin Nayif, employed other Surooriyyah's scholars, but their effect was less than the effect of Hamid Al-Ali.",2009,03,02,2009-03-02 00:00:00.000,2004

The raids came after a suicide bomb plot by suspected Islamic extremists in Melbourne was uncovered. The group is thought to be linked to extremists in Somalia. Police believe the group was planning to launch an attack on an Australian army base, possibly in Victoria. Victoria has four army bases – in Albury-Wodonga, Puckapunyal, Watsonia and Broadmeadows – as well as three RAAF bases and a Navy base at Crib Point. Emily Howard, 21, lives about four doors away from where one of the warrants was executed in View St, Glenroy. She said it was scary to think something like this could be happening in her own street. Ms Howard said she didn’t hear any police sirens or noise during the raid. The first she heard of it was this morning when her boyfriend told her after seeing it on TV. “I thought it was a joke,” she said. “To think someone in your street could do something like that. It’s just horrible.” She said she had lived on the “quiet” street for 15 years. The mass counter-terrorism operation, the second largest ever in Australia, involved the Australian Federal Police, Victoria and NSW Police, the NSW Crime Commission and the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation. At least 400 officers were involved in the raid. A spokesman for Premier John Brumby said: ""The Premier has received a preliminary briefing. The Government will await further advice before commenting further."" The Australian reports the members of the group had been discovered carrying out surveillance on the Holsworthy Barracks in Western Sydney. The group is reportedly inspired by the Somalia-based terrorist movement al-Shabaab, with two Melbourne members thought to have travelled to Somalia to train with the al-Qaida aligned terror group. Al-Shabaab, which is using suicide bombers and jihadist fighters in an attempt to overthrow the Somali government, seeks to impose a pure, hardline form of Islam, and sees the West as its enemy. It has been declared a terrorist organisation by the US and it has close links with al-Qaida leaders, including Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, an architect of the 1998 attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in which 223 people died. The suspects include Australians of Somali and Lebanese decent, most of whom are labourers employed in Melbourne's construction industry, or taxi drivers. It is understood that several members of the group also wanted to travel to Somalia to fight with al-Shabaab, but when travel became difficult, they turned their attention to carrying out a terrorist attack in Australia. Al-Shabaab is currently searching for jihadist recruits around the world, including in Australia. Authorities fear that Australian Muslims who travel to Somalia to fight for al-Shabaab could return to Australia as sleeper agents for future attacks in this country. - By Cameron Stewart, Sarah Wotherspoon http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/sto...65-661,00.html",2009,08,03,2009-08-03 00:00:00.000,29204

11780,29241,10598,Terrorism raids in Melbourne 04/08/2009,fighter,fighter,"Phone call sparked Operation Neath Quote: IT was a single phone call that sparked the second-largest terror investigation in Australian history, known as Operation Neath. In January, at the height of Melbourne's parched summer, an Australian-Lebanese man in his 30s telephoned a Somalian in the city's western suburbs and made a disturbing request. He wanted assistance for himself and some of his friends to travel to the war-torn African state of Somalia. The men wanted to become Islamic warriors with al-Shabaab, an extremist group in that country with close links to al-Qa'ida, and which is listed as a terrorist organisation by the US. The fledgling Somalian terror group, barely three years old, had become the new face of Islamic resistance in Africa and was actively recruiting foreign fighters to help it overthrow the US-backed government in Somalia. Investigators were monitoring the Lebanese man's calls after he came to their attention late last year for espousing extremist views at his local mosque in Melbourne's northern suburbs. What unfolded over the next few months would confirm the worst fears of the nation's counter-terrorism chiefs and provide a grim reminder that Australians remain vulnerable to the threat posed by a handful of Islamic extremists, living in our suburbs, who are seduced by the dark side. Australia's security agencies had suspected for several years there were illegal links between small pockets of the nation's 16,000-strong Somali community and the extremists in their war-torn homeland. But the AFP and ASIO had never been able to prove the links, and an AFP investigation called Operation Rochester in 2007 petered out after no illegal connections were identified. Now the authorities had found what they were looking for. And they would find much more than they bargained for. Authorities learned that the Somalian man who had been contacted by their Lebanese suspect was the “facilitator”, or point man, for Australian jihadists seeking to travel to the failed state and join the al-Shabaab resistance there. Working from Melbourne's western suburbs, this travel agent for would-be jihadists had close connections with al-Shabaab members in Somalia and was able to arrange funding and logistics for Melbourne recruits. Authorities believe he had in recent months arranged for two Somali Australians to be smuggled into Somalia, via Kenya, to train with al-Shabaab. One of those Australian men remains in Somalia, where he is presumed to be training or fighting with al-Shabaab. The other Somalian man has recently returned to Melbourne. But the Lebanese man proved more problematic for the Somalian facilitator in Melbourne. Visa and passport difficulties prevented him from making the trip to Somalia. Frustrated by his inability to travel abroad to join al-Shabaab, the Lebanese man and the core hardline group discussed their options. Investigators listened in horror as the men were then overheard planning a terrorist attack in Australia. From that moment, about three months ago, the top-secret investigation known as Operation Neath became the dominant focus of Australia's national security agencies. Jointly run by the AFP, Victoria Police and ASIO, the investigation comprises about 150 police, intelligence agents and officials. The group of suspects, involving Lebanese and Somali Australians, is believed to total about 18 men, with a core of hardliners. While they are deeply religious, there are no imams, or self-styled religious leaders, among them. They are working-class men, consisting mostly of construction labourers and taxi drivers. None is believed to be tertiary educated, and they seem to have a limited understanding of the international affairs and events on which they justify their violent religious crusade. The electronic evidence gathered by police against the group is chilling. Investigators listened as the men discussed a suicide attack on an Australian army base. The only reason offered for such an attack was the presence of Australian troops in Muslim countries, although Afghanistan and Iraq were not mentioned by name. The plan was for the group to storm the entrance to an army base, firing automatic weapons. They would kill as many Australian soldiers as possible until they were themselves killed. None of them would surrender. But hopes that this was nothing more than hairy-chested rhetoric were soon dashed when surveillance teams followed one of the suspects to Holsworthy Barracks in southwestern Sydney. The historic military base is home to Australia's elite Parachute Battalion and Commando Regiment. Investigators watched as the suspect quietly cased the scene, observing movements of people and traffic. Other suspicious behaviour near Victorian defence bases raised concerns of investigators that the group might also be conducting reconnaissance missions in that state. In addition, the suspects were overheard discussing ways to obtain firearms, and swapping notes on which of their family and friends had firearm licences. Gathering evidence against the group was a painstaking task, with the suspects often taking steps to evade surveillance by meeting in their local mosque or holding discussions in parks. But several months ago there was a hitch in the group's plans. One of the group's core players, the Lebanese man who originally sparked the investigation, suddenly found himself in jail for alleged assault. He had been involved in a confrontation with a nearby resident over a minor matter and was put behind bars, making it difficult for authorities to assess how close the group might be to carrying out the attack. Investigators were also concerned about another member of the group, a Somalian, who returned to Australia last month after receiving military training from al-Shabaab in Somalia. Training with al-Shabaab usually involves a six-week course covering guerilla tactics and instruction on how to handle explosives. However, Somalia is a lawless, failed state that remains a blackhole for Western intelligence agencies. Australian agencies do not know what sort of training the Australian might have received there, but they do know the man did not finish his full training course. It is unclear why he cut short his training and returned to Melbourne. Authorities were concerned that this man, who holds an Australian passport, might have become further energised and radicalised while in Somalia, and may have returned to Melbourne to encourage the Melbourne cell to carry out the plan sooner rather than later. These uncertainties placed authorities in a dilemma. Continuing to monitor the activities of the group would allow investigators the chance to gather new intelligence to maximise their chances of securing convictions against the men. But not acting quickly would risk the unthinkable prospect of the group actually carrying out the attack. Faced with these decisions, the AFP is understood to have recently presented its evidence against the Melbourne cell to the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, which advised that the evidence was sufficient to support charges being laid under national terrorism laws. In recent weeks plans were drawn up for an extensive series of raids on properties across Melbourne. Sources said these raids were to take place as early as this morning after it was concluded, at a series of high-level meetings over the weekend, that immediate action was justified to prevent the possibility of innocent lives being lost. SOURCE Quote: JOINT counter terrorism raids, the result of a seven-month surveillance operation, has led to four arrests, Australian Federal Police acting Chief Commissioner Tony Negus said today. Terrorists were planning a suicide mission involving semi-automatic weapons on an Australian miliary base, he said. The four people arrested, all Australian citizens, are being interviewed and several others are assisting with inquiries. Police are currently interviewing a 26-year-old Carlton man, a 25-year-old Preston man, a 25-year-old man from Glenroy and a 22-year-old man from Meadow Heights.. The raids involved the Australian Federal Police (AFP), the Victoria Police, NSW Police, the NSW Crime Commission and Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). Despite the operation, Mr Negus said national security levels remained at medium. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Simon Overland said search warrants issued across Melbourne and at Colac in the state's south-west may take 24 hours to complete. Mr Overland stressed the overwhelming number of Islamic people in Australia and Melbourne were valued members of the community, not terrorists. He said he was disappointed by leaks that lead to reporting of the raids in The Australian newspaper. Copies of the newspaper were publicly available at 1.30am (AEST) in Melbourne, well ahead of the raids, he said. Mr Overland said police acted after it ""got to a point where we decided it was appropriate to act"". Mr Negus said there could be further arrests, other than four people in custody. He confirmed the Holsworthy Base in Sydney was an alleged target, as well as ""suspicious activity around other bases"". Mr Negus said the allegations related specifically to an attack with firearms, not bombs. ""We believe these men were affiliated with a group called al-Shabaab in Somalia,"" he said. On the raids, Mr Negus said: ""We were satisfied the timing was right - obviously the primary concern is public safety."" He stressed the police information at this stage was only a series of allegations that needed to be tested in court. Mr Negus said, however, if the alleged plot had been carried out, it would have been the most serious terrorist act ever on Australian soil. About 400 police were used to execute 19 search warrants about 4.30am (AEST) on Tuesday. Homes in the northern Melbourne suburbs of Glenroy, Meadow Heights, Roxburgh Park, Broadmeadows, Westmeadows, Preston and Epping were raided by police, as well as at Carlton in inner Melbourne and Colac in south-western Victoria. Four arrests in terror raids | The Australian Quote: 4th of August Source A plot by Islamic extremists in Melbourne to launch a suicide attack on an Australian Army base has been uncovered by national security agencies. Federal and state police, armed with search warrants, swooped on members of the suspected terror cell this morning, as they seek to arrest Australian nationals of Somali and Lebanese background in what will be the second-largest counter-terrorism operation in the nation's history. The men are expected to be charged with a range of terrorism-related offences. Authorities believe the group is at an advanced stage of preparing to storm an Australian Army base, using automatic weapons, as punishment for Australia's military involvement in Muslim countries. It is understood the men plan to kill as many soldiers as possible before they are themselves killed. Members of the group have been observed carrying out surveillance of Holsworthy Barracks in western Sydney and other suspicious activity around defence bases in Victoria. Electronic surveillance on the suspects is believed to have picked up discussions about ways to obtain weapons to carry out what would be the worst terror attack on Australian soil. The cell has been inspired by the Somalia-based terrorist movement al-Shabaab, with two Melbourne men, both Somalis, having travelled to Somalia in recent months to obtain training with the extremist organisation, which is aligned with al-Qa'ida. One of those men has already returned to Melbourne. The other is still in Somalia. Al-Shabaab, which is using suicide bombers and jihadist fighters to try to overthrow the Somali government, seeks to impose a pure, hardline form of Islam, and sees the West as its enemy. It has been declared a terrorist organisation by the US and it has close links with al-Qa'ida leaders, including Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, an architect of the 1998 attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in which 223 people died. The investigation of the group, dubbed Operation Neath, involves about 150 members of the Australian Federal Police, Victoria Police and ASIO. It was launched in late January. Search warrants for at least 19 properties across Melbourne have been prepared to allow authorities to obtain more evidence against the group, which is believed to number about 18, with a smaller, hardcore element. The suspects include Australians of Somali and Lebanese decent, most of whom are labourers employed in Melbourne's construction industry, or taxi drivers. It is understood that several members of the group also wanted to travel to Somalia to fight with al-Shabaab, but when travel became difficult, they turned their attention to carrying out a terrorist attack in Australia. Al-Shabaab is currently searching for jihadist recruits around the world, including in Australia. Authorities fear that Australian Muslims who travel to Somalia to fight for al-Shabaab could return to Australia as sleeper agents for future attacks in this country. In the US, more than 20 Somali American men have disappeared from their Midwest homes in recent months to fight alongside al-Shabaab troops in Somalia. The FBI's investigation into the radicalisation of Somali refugees in the US, via al-Shabaab, was described by The New York Times last month as “the most significant domestic terror investigation since September 11”. The AFP is understood to have recently presented its evidence against the Melbourne cell to the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, which advised that the evidence was sufficient to support charges being laid under national terrorism laws. A previous AFP investigation _ Operation Rochester, in 2007 _ into extremist activities within small pockets of the nation's 16,000-strong Muslim Somali community petered out after it was established there was no evidence of wrongdoing. Only a small number of Australia's Somali community adopt the hardline Wahabist view of Islam, but authorities fear radicalism among this minority is being fanned by recent events in Somalia. Intelligence analysts warn that Somalia has become the new breeding for international Islamic terrorists, as extremists seek revenge for the events of December 2006, when US-backed forces from Christian Ethiopia toppled the hardline government known as the Islamic Courts Union. The US and Australia defended the Ethiopian invasion as a front in the global war on terror, but it awakened the nationalism of many Somalis in Australia, as well as Muslims of other ethnic backgrounds, who viewed it as a Christian crusade into a Muslim land.",2009,08,04,2009-08-04 00:00:00.000,29204

The suspects are Australian nationals of Somali and Lebanese descent; one man, aged 25, has so far been charged with terrorism offences. The man from the Glenroy district of Melbourne is due in court later. Two other men are expected to be charged, while a court has granted police another eight hours to question the fourth man. A fifth man, who had been detained earlier, is also being questioned about the alleged plot.

Holsworthy Barracks on the outskirts of Sydney was one of the planned targets, according to police. The attack would have been the most serious terrorist attack on Australian soil, Mr Negus added. ""Members of the group have been actively seeking a fatwa or religious ruling to justify a terror attack on Australia,"" he said. ""The sobering element of today's development is the reminder to all Australians that the threat of terrorism is alive and well, and this requires continued vigilance on the part of our security authorities,"" said Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.

11837,29317,10598,Terrorism raids in Melbourne 04/08/2009,714,juhayman,"AP – Police search a car at a Melbourne suburb after a pre-dawn raid at one of 19 locations Tuesday, Aug. … MELBOURNE, Australia – Australian police said Tuesday they have thwarted a terrorist plot in which extremists with ties to an al-Qaida-linked Somali Islamist group planned to invade a military base and open fire with automatic weapons until they were shot dead themselves. Some 400 officers from state and national security services took part in 19 raids on properties in Melbourne, Australia's second largest city, before dawn Tuesday, arresting four men and detaining several others for questioning, police said. Australian Federal Police Acting Commissioner Tony Negus said the raids followed a seven-month surveillance operation of a group of people with alleged ties to al-Shabaab, an Islamist organization based in that country's south that has been fighting to overthrow Somalia's transitional government. ""Police will allege that the men were planning to carry out a suicide terrorist attack on a defense establishment within Australia involving an armed assault with automatic weapons,"" Negus told reporters. ""Details of the planning indicated the alleged offenders were prepared to inflict a sustained attack on military personnel until they themselves were killed."" Holsworthy Barracks on the outskirts of Sydney was one of the group's potential targets, and surveillance had been carried out at other bases, he said, declining to identify them. ""This operation has disrupted an alleged terrorist attack that could have claimed many lives,"" he said. Negus said the investigation had also found that some of the group had traveled to Somalia ""to participate in hostilities"" there. All four arrested are Australian citizens of Somali or Lebanese descent and aged between 22 and 26, police said. One of the suspects, Nayes El Sayad, was formally charged in Melbourne Magistrate's Court with conspiring to plan a terrorist attack, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. Another suspect, Saney Aweys, also appeared in court, where police sought and were granted permission to detain him longer without charge for questioning. Neither man formally entered any plea, though Aweys told the magistrate he had no connection to the other suspects. Federal police agent David Kinton told the court that police evidence included intercepted phone calls and text messages between the suspects. The Age newspaper reported on its Web site that one of the messages referred to the Holsworthy base, saying: ""I stalked around. It is easy to enter."" Negus said authorities involved in the massive surveillance operation decided to move against the group after carefully weighing up how advanced the attack plan was. He said the group was actively seeking a fatwa, or Islamic religious ruling, approving their plans for the Australian attack. Negus did not say whose approval was being sought. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the plot underscored that Australia is still under threat from extremist groups enraged that the country sent troops to join the U.S.-led military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. ""As the Australian government has said consistently, there is an enduring threat from terrorism at home here in Australia as well as overseas,"" Rudd told reporters in the northern city of Cairns. ""This is a sober reminder that the threat of terrorism to Australia continues."" Rudd said the government did raise Australia's terrorist alert level as a result of the plot because authorities had advised him that was not necessary. Police sealed off several houses in Melbourne after the raids and were conducting intensive searches. Forensic officers in protective suits collected samples and searched at least one car parked in a driveway, while uniformed officers interviewed neighbors. Terrorist violence is extremely rare in Australia — a 1978 bombing near the Hilton Hotel that killed two is the best-known incident — and no attacks have been carried out on Australian soil since the Sept. 11 attacks in the U.S. raised security threat levels worldwide. But dozens of Australians have died in terrorist attacks overseas, mostly in Indonesia including the 2002 bombings in Bali that targeted nightclubs frequented by Australians and other foreigners. The Somali-linked plot Tuesday is the second major coordinated attack plan exposed in Australia in recent years. Seven men were imprisoned in the past year for involvement in a nascent plot to target thousands of spectators in an attack major sporting events in Australia. Negus said the Somali-linked plot, if it had been carried out, could have been the most serious terrorist attack on Australian soil. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Australia introduced tough new counterterrorism laws that grant police and security agencies strong surveillance and detention powers, and stiffened prison sentences for convicted terrorists. Australia does not have the death penalty. Al-Shabaab, which conducts frequent attacks in Somalia, is seeking to overthrow the Horn of Africa nation's Western-backed government and establish an Islamic state. The group has claimed responsibility for several high-profile bombings and shootings in the Somali capital of Mogadishu, targeting Ethiopian troops and Somali government officials. It has also killed journalists and international aid workers. The U.S. State Department says al-Shabaab has provided a safe haven to al-Qaida ""elements"" wanted for the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The two groups have long been suspected of working together, but they have not announced a formal alliance. Al-Qaida has operations in North Africa, Yemen and Iraq. ___ Associated Press writers Kristen Gelineau and Rohan Sullivan in Sydney contributed to this report.",2009,08,04,2009-08-04 00:00:00.000,29204

Network) — The Australian police on Tuesday arrested four men with suspected links to a Somalia-based Islamic organization, saying they planned to stage a suicide attack on an Australian military base.

No date was given for the alleged attack. “This operation has disrupted an alleged terrorist attack that could have claimed many lives,” the acting federal police commissioner, Tony Negus, told reporters in Melbourne. He said the men “were prepared to inflict a sustained attack on military personnel until they themselves were killed.” Officials say the suspects were affiliated with Al Shabab, an Islamic organization that controls much of southern Somalia and has been waging an insurgency against the country’s fragile, Western-backed transitional government. The United States considers the group a terrorist organization, saying it harbors Al Qaeda operatives wanted for orchestrating the 1998 bombings of the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Clive Williams, a terrorism expert at the Strategic and Defense Studies Center of the Australian National University, said that increased scrutiny of Al Shabab has made it harder for sympathetic Muslim youths to travel to Somalia unnoticed, making conditions ripe for Shabab-inspired attacks elsewhere. “Now that it has become more difficult to go there, the alternative is to go somewhere else, or do something in your home country,” Mr. Williams said. “Given that Australia’s foreign policy is closely aligned with that of the United States in many areas, particularly in relation to Afghanistan, it would make sense to wage an attack in Australia to protest against Australia’s policies.” Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced on April 29 that Australia would add 450 soldiers to its contingent in Afghanistan, increasing its force there to about 1,550. Mr. Rudd said at the time that President Obama had persuaded him to increase the deployment during discussions the previous week. Mr. Rudd said the arrests on Tuesday offered a sobering reminder of the “enduring threat from terrorism at home, here in Australia, as well as overseas.” The police charged one of the men, Nayef El Sayed, 25, with conspiring to plan or prepare for a terrorist attack. Mr. Sayed did not enter a plea or apply for bail when he appeared briefly before the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday. He refused to stand up when the judge entered the chambers because, his lawyer told the court, his religious beliefs prevented him from standing before anyone but God, according to local reporters who attended the hearing. The magistrate gave the police an eight-hour extension to continue questioning another man, Saney Aweys, into Tuesday night. He and two other suspects have not been charged. Mr. Aweys, who declined legal representation, told the court that he did not know the other three men. But prosecutors said that the federal police had intercepted numerous telephone conversations and text messages referring to the planned attack. The authorities said they planned to use these telephone intercepts and video footage of one of the men allegedly arriving at the Holsworthy base on March 28, as evidence. The police said at least one of the men had traveled to Somalia to participate in the insurgency there, and members of the group were trying to persuade Islamic leaders to issue a fatwa, or religious edict, supporting the planned attack. If the accusations are true, the men join the ranks of Somali expatriates and Muslim youths who have been drawn to Al Shabab, which means “youth” in Arabic. Officials in the United States have also been investigating whether a group of young men from Minnesota were recruited by the group to join the influx of foreign militants fighting against Somalia’s transitional government. Australia has not had a major attack on its territory in recent years. However, a number of people are serving lengthy prison sentences for plots that have been uncovered since the government imposed tough anti-terror laws in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001. Dozens of Australians have been killed in attacks overseas, including three people who were killed in simultaneous suicide bomb attacks at two American hotels in Jakarta, Indonesia, last month; 88 Australians were killed when Islamic extremists bombed a bar and a nightclub on the Indonesian island of Bali in October 2002.",2009,08,04,2009-08-04 00:00:00.000,29204

11908,29437,10598,Terrorism raids in Melbourne 04/08/2009,930,wa1slama,"From Times Online August 4, 2009 Al-Shabaab extremists unlikely to be linked to Australian plot Catherine Philp, Diplomatic Correspondent If the Islamists arrested in yesterday’s pre-dawn raids were plotting to storm Australian army bases, it is unlikely that al-Shabaab told them to do it. The al-Qaeda linked extremist group has been conducting a massive international recruitment among the Somali diaspora to bolster its forces as it fights for control of Mogadishu and the imposition of strict Islamic rule across Somalia. The young men it lures from Western countries such as Britain, Germany, Canada, Australia and the United States join a Somali jihad, not a transnational movement, such as al-Qaeda, which has global aspirations. In May, The Times reported that up to a thousand foreign fighters, including Britons, have answered the call to jihad in Somalia and its war-torn capital, Mogadishu. What al-Shabaab cannot do is stop the foreign fighters it has radicalised in its training camps from returning home to attack domestic targets in the name of Islam. Western intelligence agencies have repeatedly warned of the risk of returning ethnic Somalis doing just that. Al-Shabaab is keen to keep its foreign fighters committed to the Somali jihad. Their efforts are said to have greatly contributed to the Islamists’ recent military successes. But to attract such recruits, al-Shabaab’s own propaganda plays up its ties with other Islamist insurgencies such as Algeria and Chechnya. And al-Qaeda’s promotion of al-Shabaab — Osama bin Laden has personally urged followers to join the fight there — has widened its appeal among Islamist communities around the world with broader concerns than just Somalia. The fear is that an al-Shabaab takeover will make Somalia into a magnet for foreign jihadist seeking training, just as Taleban rule in Afghanistan gave al-Qaeda a haven to establish training camps where thousands of foreign militants flocked. Al-Shabaab is already drifting towards the kind of dependency on al-Qaeda that the Taleban developed, allowing the extremist group to call its shots. The United Nations and Western intelligence agencies have warned that hundreds of al-Qaeda fighters are on the move from Pakistan to Yemen and Somalia. The CIA has attributed the move to the pressure placed on al-Qaeda by drone missile strikes that have killed more than twenty senior leaders. Terrorist experts, however, say that for the moment, al-Qaeda fighters travelling to Somalia are more likely to be seeking war than sanctuary. Even with the threat of drone strikes, Pakistan’s tribal areas remain the safest place for senior al-Qaeda leaders to hide. CIA missile strikes on Yemen and Somalia have killed several al-Qaeda operatives since 2001 without provoking anything like the backlash they do in Pakistan. In that respect, the weakness of the Somali government is an asset. The US is the latest Western country to voice concern about the threat of radicalised youth returning home from Somalia after the discovery of a huge recruiting ring in Minneapolis. US interference in Somalia, backing the government against al-Shabaab and its allies in the ousted Islamic Courts regime, may have made the West a greater target for al-Shabaab than it ever was.",2009,08,04,2009-08-04 00:00:00.000,29204

12238,29957,10598,Terrorism raids in Melbourne 04/08/2009,guest1,guest1,"Four men charged with terrorism offences after Melbourne raids http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/sto...23-661,00.html Paul Anderson, Mark Buttler August 05, 2009 12:00am UPDATE 7.42pm: INVESTIGATIONS have been launched into the leak of information about counter-terrorism raids published before the operation. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) says that after learning of the leak last week, it immediately referred the breach to its Professional Standards area and an investigation was launched last Friday. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Simon Overland has confirmed the Office of Police Integrity (OPI) will also conduct a wide-ranging inquiry, while the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) has also announced it will investigate the leak. The AFP and OPI will co-ordinate the outcomes of their investigations. Mr Overland said the details published in The Australian potentially compromised the safety of police officers involved in the joint operation. ""It is a very, very serious breach of security,'' he said. ""If it has come from a law enforcement officer or a Victoria Police officer, it is a criminal offence.'' Mr Overland said the offence of unlawfully releasing information carried a jail term. The Australian rejected claims the leaked information appeared at 1.30am (AEST), three hours before the raids, saying early editions were held back while the raids took place. Editor Paul Whittaker said he was ""disturbed'' by the ""misinformation'' surrounding the newspaper's story. ""The AFP was absolutely aware of the logistical intricacies of the national distribution of our newspaper, and The Australian agreed to withhold publication of the raids until the latest editions of the newspaper, and to keep all references off our internet site,'' Mr Whittaker said today. ""The Australian honoured that agreement absolutely, and the AFP acknowledges that.'' But Mr Overland said he was confident the newspaper leaked the information before the raids were carried out. ""I have a law enforcement officer who bought the paper at 1.30am (AEST) yesterday morning,'' he said. The Integrity Commissioner, Mr Philip Moss, said the ACLEI investigation would focus on determining if any AFP members were behind the security breach. Meanwhile, one of four men who appeared in court today on terror charges shouted angrily at the magistrate before being led away. Wissam Mahmoud Fattal appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court today after being charged with conspiring with four men and other unknown people to prepare an armed attack on Holsworthy army base. Mr Fattal refused to stand on the order of magistrate Peter Reardon, citing religious beliefs that he would stand for no man but only for God. Before being led away Mr Fattal ranted about overseas hostilities saying: “Your army kill innocent people in Afghanistan and Iraq. You call us terrorists that’s not true...”. He said he had never killed a person in his life. Coolly, Mr Reardon replied: “Yes, thank you”. Mr Reardon also said he did not accept Mr Fattal’s reasons for not standing and said it showed a lack of respect to the court. He said it was an issue that would be dealt with at later hearings if it continued. Mr Fattal appeared in court along with Abdirahman Ahmed and Yacqub Khayre, who were also charged with conspiring with four men and other unknown people to prepare an armed attack on Holsworthy. Mr Ahmed is also facing a charge of aid, abet counsel or procure the commission of an offence by Walid Osman Mohamed – namely the engagement by Mohamed in a hostile act in a foreign state, namely Somalia. None of the three applied for bail, although the court heard they were expected to do so in the near future. Saney Edow Aweys was the last to appear in court this afternoon. He faces three charges, including the same conspiracy charge as his co-accused and another charge related to the aiding and abetting of a person engaged in hostile acts. His lawyer said it was uncertain at this stage as to whether he would apply for bail in the future. Nayef El Sayed, 25, from Glenroy, appeared in court yesterday and was also charged with conspiring with four men and other unknown people to prepare an armed attack on Holsworthy. All four men who appeared in court today were remanded in custody to join Mr El Sayed in the same court for a committal mention on October 26. Yesterday's raids followed months of planning which came down to split-second timing as 400 officers swooped on alleged terrorists at 19 properties before dawn. Teams of police - some including heavily armed special operations officers - moved into position across Melbourne and Victoria. At precisely 4.30am, Operation Neath sprang into action. Victorian Police, federal police and ASIO officers burst into modest suburban houses, high-rise towers and a home in the Western District. The noise was ""thunderous"", according to a woman who lives next door to a house raided in Meadow Heights. ""We just heard a really, really loud noise and heard people shouting 'Open the door' and 'Show your hands',"" she said. ""My kids were so scared. ""We looked out of the window and didn't know what was going on. My husband went out and asked what was happening and they said 'Look, it's ASIO. We can't say anything, you'll find out on the news'."" The scene was repeated in Colac where police shattered the pre-dawn quiet. Daniel Lyons, 29, who lives near a raided property, said he heard a commotion when he was woken by his nine-month-old baby. ""I noticed about eight to 10 officers out the front,"" he said. ""They ran through the house, yelling out 'Get down, get down!' ""There was a lot of commotion, there was a fair bit of banging. No one was yelling back at them, though, and there was no gunfire."" Mr Lyons said the home's occupants had kept to themselves and barely opened the blinds of the house. The 400 officers had been fully briefed on the task and what to expect from targets. Police were followed into each home by forensic chemists looking for evidence to back terrorism allegations. The thoroughness was evident as investigators rummaged through bins and took away vacuum cleaners. A white Mazda hatchback with construction clothing in the back was delivered to federal police city headquarters on a tow truck. Close attention will be paid to the contents of computer equipment seized. In another Meadow Heights street investigators left at 10am with bags of seized goods and a pole. A neighbour said the family had lived at the property for just over a year and had a six-month-old and a toddler. ""They're very, very quiet people. Sometimes you might hear a baby,"" she said. ""The wife is nice and says hello. ""She said she was going to stay at her mother's while her husband was overseas. ""He was overseas for about a month, I think, about five weeks ago."" In Glenroy, a woman who said she was the sister of one of the men being investigated said she was shocked. ""The police have taken everything. We can't get in the house,"" she said. One neighbour said the man was a nice Muslim boy who had grown up in the street and become very religious over the past few years. Around the corner residents said they knew little of a family living at a raided house. One neighbour said the family was of Somali origin and had moved into the rental home about four months ago. At Broadmeadows, a man living nearby said it was a meeting place. He said the family, believed to be of Lebanese background, had lived there for more than two years. ""Many people were coming to the house,"" he said. ""We saw some children. He was a businessman, but I don't know what he did."" In Colac, the raid reminded Thomas Clarke of an Islam pamphlet handed to him recently by a neighbour. ""Learn the basics,"" the cover said.

12239,29958,10598,Terrorism raids in Melbourne 04/08/2009,guest1,guest1,"Terror cell' sent money to extremists The Australian August 05,2009 POLICE believe members of an alleged Melbourne terror cell have been providing funding to the militant extremist group al-Shabaab in Somalia. But charges are unlikely to be brought against the men because the amounts involved were small and convictions would be difficult to obtain, given that al-Shabaab is not listed in Australia as a terrorist organisation. The revelations come as police laid terror charges against another four of the men arrested in Tuesday morning's dawn raids, including counts of planning to go to Somalia to fight in the civil war and helping someone else do the same. A Melbourne Magistrates Court hearing for the men yesterday was tense, with family and friends clashing verbally with police as they entered the court. Inside the court, one of the accused, 33-year-old Wissam Mahmoud Fattal, launched a tirade about the Australian military being the real terrorists. ""You call me a terrorist, I have never killed anyone in my life,"" Mr Fattal shouted. ""Your army kills innocent people in Iraq."" Mr Fattal also attacked Israeli forces, commented on the Palestinian situation and said Australian troops were killing innocent people in Afghanistan. ""Take me from this country,"" he said as he was being led from the court by security guards. In the courtroom, supporters of the accused showed little respect for magistrate Peter Reardon, reading newspapers, talking and even pointing out to one suspect in the dock that his face was on the front page. ""It's not a library, if you want to read the newspaper, go outside,"" Mr Reardon snapped at three young men. Police have alleged that members of the accused group wanted to go to Somalia to fight with al-Shabaab, which is said to be linked with al-Qa'ida. Charge sheets tendered to the court reveal that police allege Saney Edow Aweys conducted ""preparations"" to go ""engage in hostile activities"" in Somalia between June 1 and August 4. They also allege the 26-year-old boilermaker from Carlton North aided and abetted Walid Osman Mohamed in going to Somalia to engage in a ""hostile act"" from November 14 last year to August 4. The third charge Mr Aweys faces is conspiring with Wissam Mahmoud Fattal, Nayef El Sayed, Yacqub Khayre and Abdirahman Ahmed to prepare for a terrorist attack on the Holsworthy army base in Sydney's southwest. Mr Ahmed, 25, is also charged with helping Mr Mohamed go to Somalia to fight, as well as conspiring with the four others to launch a suicide attack on the Holsworthy army base. The court heard Mr Khayre, 22, and Mr Fattal, 33, had also been charged with the same terrorism offence. The Australian has learned that during the course of the seven-month investigation, dubbed Operation Neath, authorities allegedly uncovered evidence the terror suspects had sent funds from Melbourne to members of al-Shabaab in Somalia. The sums detected were relatively small, amounting only to thousands of dollars. It is the first time direct funding from Australia to extremists in Somalia has been detected. A previous 2007 Australian Federal Police investigation into a suspected funding of Islamic extremists in Somalia by members of Melbourne's Somali community did not identify illegal funding. The AFP said yesterday it would investigate what it described as a ""security breach"" that resulted in The Australian obtaining details of the counter terrorism operation six days before raids took place. Victoria's Office of Police Integrity is conducting its own investigation into how the newspaper obtained the story. SOURCE: The Australian, August 5, 2009",2009,08,06,2009-08-06 00:00:00.000,29204

The claim came after one man faced court and four others were still being questioned late on Tuesday night over an alleged suicide plot to kill Australian soldiers. Police said it would have been the deadliest terrorist attack on Australian soil. Australian Federal Police acting Chief Commissioner Tony Negus said the men were allegedly planning a suicide shoot-out with automatic weapons at Holsworthy army base in Sydney. ""The men's intention was to actually go into the army barracks and to kill as many soldiers as they could before they themselves were killed,"" Mr Negus said. ""Potentially this would have been, if it had been able to be carried out, the most serious terrorist attack on Australian soil."" He said investigators believed the men had links to a north African terrorist group, al-Shabaab, which has links to al-Qaida. Victorian police, AFP officers and ASIO agents raided 19 properties across Melbourne and regional Victoria before dawn. Nayef El Sayed, 25, from Glenroy, appeared in Melbourne Magistrates' Court charged with conspiring with four men and other unknown people to prepare an armed attack on Holsworthy base for several thousand troops. He refused to stand when asked by a magistrate. Mr El Sayed said through his lawyer he stood for no man other than his own God. Three other suspects - Saney Edow Aweys, Yacqub Khayre and Abdirahman Ahmed - appeared in court as police requested more time to interview them. Police also were interviewing a fifth man, a 33-year-old who is already in custody in relation to other matters, the court heard. Melbourne Magistrates' Court was told the alleged cell had sought the blessing of an Islamic sheik for the attack. ""We believe that Abdirahman Ahmed was seeking a fatwah, and that fatwah could have assisted the group in committing the act,"" AFP agent Niranjan Jirasinha told the court. ""There were several seeking it, but he was one."" It was alleged telephone conversations and text messages were exchanged between members of the cell, with one telling another he had strolled around Holsworthy army base and it was easy to enter. Magistrate Peter Reardon remanded Mr El Sayed in custody to reappear in court on October 26. He granted police an extra eight hours to question the other men. If charged, they will appear before Mr Reardon on Wednesday. Somali Community in Victoria spokesman Abdurahman Osman said he had raised the prospect of a terrorist attack in Australia at least 10 times over the past three years because of the activities of al-Shabaab around the world. And Islamic scholar and Sydney Somali community leader Dr Herse Hilole said he warned the Federal Government two years ago. ""The response at the beginning was good but the current government of Australia . . . seems that they did not take this seriously,"" he said. The Islamic Council of Victoria is calling for calm amid fears of a backlash. ""The overwhelming majority of Australian Muslims unequivocally condemn all forms of terrorism,"" vice-president Shereen Hassan said. Somalia Advocacy Action group spokesman Mohamed Baaruud said the community was in shock. ""Our community came to Australia about 17 years ago when the civil war started in Somalia and it took us a long time to recover from the trauma that we have experienced in our country of origin and start a new life here in Australia,"" he said. - with Geraldine Mitchell and Paul Anderson",2009,08,06,2009-08-06 00:00:00.000,29204

Neil Fergus said al-Shabaab had carried out numerous beheadings, stonings and amputations as well as killing peace workers, humanitarian volunteers and political opponents in Somalia. The radical Islamist group has links to al-Qaida and profits from piracy off the Somali coast. Mr Fergus said Australian Somalis had been returning to their homeland for 20 years to fight in wars that have pushed the country back into the Stone Age. Analysts have warned of the increasing danger of Western recruits joining extremist ranks in Somalia since early 2007 when the hard-line Islamic Courts Union was ousted from power by opposition forces backed by Ethiopia and the US. The victors were portrayed as Christian crusaders in a Muslim land. Al-Shabaab, or ""Islamic Youth"", was born from this latest chapter in Somalia's chaotic history. Its aim is to establish sharia rule of law, imposing brutal penalties for religious slights and alleged adultery. Al-Shabaab is outlawed in the US and some Scandinavian countries. A few Australian-Somali dual-nationals, part of a 16,000-strong Somali community in Australia, have returned to their homeland to fight or train. Melbourne man Ahmed Ali went home in 2007 to fight for the Islamic Courts Union, but was reportedly killed. Another Victorian dual-national, Hossein Hashi Farah, also allegedly went to Somalia to take up arms. The US has been another recruiting ground for Somali jihad organisers, with some suspected of visiting Australia to encourage potential fighters to sign up. Extremist elements have been dispatching al-Shabaab members from Minneapolis on regular fundraising and lecturing trips, a prominent US Somali leader said. He said the Australian al-Shabaab members were among the most important in the group. ""I know for sure that at least five of them that are well known in that community are from that part of the world (Australia),"" he said. ""People here have been flying to Australia, doing lectures and fundraising, then coming back."" The FBI confirmed it has been in touch with Australian authorities over al-Shabaab. ""We have a particularly outstanding relationship with our Australian partners and mutual concerns over these and other counter-terrorism issues,"" a spokesman said. Minneapolis, the Somali capital of the US, is home to up to 32,000 citizens from the war-torn African nation. Last week, a Minneapolis man pleaded guilty to supporting al-Shabaab. Community leader Omar Aimed told a US congressional committee in March the extremists wanted Western youths because they had no clan loyalties in Somalia. ""Al-Shabaab is not only interested in recruiting Somali-American youth but others in other Western countries, such as UK, Germany, Canada and Australia,"" Mr Aimed said.",2009,08,06,2009-08-06 00:00:00.000,29204

12245,29965,10598,Terrorism raids in Melbourne 04/08/2009,guest1,guest1,"SOMALI terror suspects Saney Edow Aweys, Yacqub Khayre and Abdirahman Ahmed began attending the controversial 8 Blacks prayer centre in North Melbourne this year, only a few months before they were charged with plotting a terrorist attack. http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au...02-601,00.html Police and intelligence agencies have long regarded the old snooker hall turned makeshift mosque, nestled behind a 7-Eleven store on Boundary Road, as a key hub in the militant islamist net-work. Agencies had placed the hall under surveillance. All three accused had previously prayed at another Melbourne mosque -- the name of which is suppressed -- before moving to 8 Blacks, where they took religious instruction in the same small ""reading group"" throughout this year. The Australian has learned that Mr Aweys, a 27-year-old father of four, started praying regularly at the mosque about January. But for at least a year before that, he visited the prayer hall on occasions, even lending his labouring skills to install a security gate at the entrance to the building's car park. It is understood he was planning to join the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, in the next three months before travelling on to Somalia alone. According to a Somali friend of Mr Aweys, who lives in the same Carlton housing commission building and who has known him for eight years, he was a ""smiling"" and ""happy"" man who appeared to enjoy life in Australia, and it was only recently that he became attracted to religion. ""He was like an Aussie boy. He used to hang out with the boys, play soccer, go to the clubs,"" the friend said. ""He had Aussie friends, wog friends -- that's Greeks and Italians to us -- and Lebanese friends. ""He wasn't religious until the last few months. 8 Blacks was only a recent thing."" Having been caught up in a Western lifestyle, older family members initially regarded Mr Aweys's new-found religiosity as a positive, helping him adhere to a disciplined, family-focused life. ""People told him: 'You gotta stop playing around, you've got a family. Go to the mosque, settle down,""' the friend said. Over time he let his beard grow, began dressing in traditional Islamic clothes and voiced more radical ideas. ""But most recently he had actually seemed to go back to normal,"" said another family friend and community elder. ""His family thought he'd dropped out (of 8 Blacks), he'd shaved his beard, he was being seen at the cafes with the rest of the community, he was working with his family again, everyone thought he was OK."" It is understood Mr Aweys was a labourer in the construction industry. He was preparing for his morning fajr prayer to Mecca on Tuesday when police raided his cramped 15th floor unit and took him away. His wife, Binte, initially left her home with her three children but returned later that night to be counselled by family and friends. She is now living at another commission flat across the road. ""Auntie, that's what I call her, she was devastated,"" says the friend, who lives in the same building. ""She couldn't believe it. No one can. I thought they must have got the wrong dude. He was a good guy, there was nothing odd about him."" A friend who plays soccer with the accused said he is worried for the wellbeing of Mr Aweys's wife. ""They (police) took his savings from his house in the raid, they accused him of funding terrorism,"" he said. ""He's the only one supporting his whole family; his wife doesn't work, his whole family are dependent on him."" Mr Aweys appeared before Melbourne Magistrates Court yesterday charged with three offences: conspiring to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act; aiding another person in a hostile act in a foreign state; and preparing for incursions into foreign states, namely Somalia, for the purpose of engaging in hostile activities. People who know Mr Aweys, and spoken to by The Australian, expressed shock at his arrest. One friend expressed disbelief at the suggestion Mr Aweys intended to leave his family and travel to Somalia. At a community meeting held yesterday in Coburg, in Melbourne's north, between police, elders and relatives of the accused, many were angry that only the ""harmless"" and the ""little fish"" had been arrested. Much of that anger came from the family of Yacqub Khayre, of Reservoir, who said he was a ""harmless dropout"" who had been targeted by police. Mr Khayre, 22, is facing one charge of conspiring to act in preparation for a terrorist act against the Holsworthy Army base in Sydney. Mr Khayre's lawyer Megan Casey applied unsuccessfully in court yesterday to have his name and image suppressed, saying he was vulnerable in custody given his age and appearance. Mr Khayre is regarded in the community as one of the ""Lost Ones"" among the 16,000 people of Somali descent who live in Australia, the vast majority in Melbourne. It is a term given to young men who struggle to adapt to life in Australia and who lose touch with Somali culture and their community after arriving as refugees from their violence-torn homeland. Elders are increasingly sending these men back to Somalia in a bid to strengthen their bond with the culture, and to develop an appreciation of the opportunities afforded them in Australia. For that reason, those close to the family say they were supportive when Mr Khayre -- who was a ""smart kid"" and ""a good student"" as a younger boy -- indicated he wanted to return to Somalia to visit relatives. But it was there, police allege, that he trained for a terrorist attack with al-Shabaab, alongside Walid Osman Mohamed, who is believed to still be in Somalia. ""The family knew he was going back, and they condoned it at the time because they thought it would help him straighten out and find his culture again,"" a source close to the family said. ""But why he would go back to Somalia with a Lebanese and what happened to him, this we don't know."" Mr Khayre allegedly switched to the 8 Blacks prayer centre four months ago. Abdirahman Ahmed, 25, is a father of two but is believed to have moved out of the Preston home he had shared with his wife and children. He began praying at 8 Blacks last December, although he continued to attend his previous mosque in Melbourne where he first met the other two co-accused. He has been charged with one count of conspiring with others to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act, and with aiding or abetting another person to engage in a hostile act in a foreign state. The director of 8 Blacks, Farah Abdi Hakim -- who leases the old two-storey snooker hall and uses the top floor as a mosque and the bottom as a community centre -- said Mr Aweys was a friend, but he did not know Mr Khayre. He denied that his community centre was a hub for Islamic zealots. ""This is my centre but it is open to everybody. I drive a cab, I am a family man, and this is a community centre -- if you came, if anyone came, you can come in,"" he said. Mr Abdi Hakim, 36, an Australian citizen with eight children, said he was concerned news of the raids would incite racism against the Somali community. ""We move from Somalia because we have a problem with al-Qa'ida there; why would we want to bring that problem here?"" heasked. ""I have lived in Australia for 20 years. Tell me, when am I going to be an Australian? When do I stop being a Somali?"" Two sources from Melbourne's Somali community said they had also attended the 8 Blacks prayer centre but nothing sinister had been preached or discussed.",2009,08,06,2009-08-06 00:00:00.000,29204

12286,30028,10879,Aide says Pakistani Taliban leader Mehsud is dead,10,Asadullah Alshishani,"DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan – Pakistan's Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud, who led a violent campaign of suicide attacks and assassinations against the Pakistani government, has been killed in a U.S. missile strike, a militant commander and aide to Mehsud said Friday. Earlier, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told reporters in Islamabad that intelligence showed Mehsud had been killed in Wednesday's missile strike on his father-in-law's house in Pakistan's lawless tribal area, but authorities would travel to the site to verify his death. Pakistani and U.S. intelligence officials said the CIA was behind the strike. All spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. ""I confirm that Baitullah Mehsud and his wife died in the American missile attack in South Waziristan,"" Taliban commander Kafayat Ullah told The Associated Press by telephone. He would not give any further details. Mehsud's demise would be a major boost to Pakistani and U.S. efforts to eradicate the Taliban and al-Qaida. However, Mehsud has deputies who could take his place. Pakistani intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Taliban commanders were already believed to be meeting in the lawless tribal areas Friday to choose a replacement. Three Pakistani intelligence officials said the likeliest successor was Mehsud's deputy, Hakim Ullah, a commander known for recruiting and training suicide bombers. Two other prominent possibilities, the officials said, were Azmat Ullah and Waliur Rehman, also close associates of Mehsud. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Whether a new leader could wreak as much havoc as Mehsud depends largely on how much pressure the Pakistani military continues to put on the network, especially in the lawless tribal area of South Waziristan. Mehsud has al-Qaida connections and has been suspected in the killing of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Pakistan views him as its top internal threat and has been preparing an offensive against him. For years, the U.S. considered Mehsud a lesser threat to its interests than some of the other Pakistani Taliban, their Afghan counterparts and al-Qaida, because most of his attacks were focused inside Pakistan, not against U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan. That view appeared to change in recent months as Mehsud's power grew and concerns mounted that increasing violence in Pakistan could destabilize the U.S. ally and threaten the entire region. The Pakistani intelligence officials said Mehsud's body was buried in the village of Nardusai in South Waziristan, near the site of the missile strike. One official said he had seen a classified intelligence report stating Mehsud was dead and buried, but that agents had not seen the body since the area is under Taliban control. Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik told reporters in Islamabad he could confirm the death of Mehsud's wife but not of the Taliban leader himself, although information pointed in that direction. ""Yes, (a) lot of information is pouring in from that area that he's dead, but I'm unable to confirm unless I have solid evidence,"" he said. Another senior Pakistani intelligence official said phone and other communications intercepts — he would not be more specific — had led authorities to suspect Mehsud was dead, but he also stressed there was no definitive evidence yet. An American counterterrorism official said the U.S. government was also looking into the reports. The official indicated the United States did not yet have physical evidence — remains — that would prove who died. But he said there were other ways of determining who was killed in the strike. He declined to describe them. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter publicly. A local tribesman, who also spoke on condition his name not be used, said Mehsud had been at his father-in-law's house being treated for kidney pain, and had been put on a drip by a doctor, when the missile struck. The tribesman claimed he attended the Taliban chief's funeral. Last year, a doctor for Mehsud announced the militant leader had died of kidney failure, but the reports turned out to be false. In Afghanistan, Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi said Mehsud's fighters would cross the border into eastern Afghanistan occasionally to help out one of most ruthless Afghan insurgent leaders Siraj Haqqani. ""He was an international terrorist that affected India, Pakistan and Afghanistan,"" Azimi said without confirming Mehsud was dead. In March, the State Department authorized a reward of up to $5 million for Mehsud. Increasingly, American missiles fired by unmanned drones have focused on Mehsud-related targets. Pakistan publicly opposes the strikes, saying they anger local tribes and make it harder for the army to operate. Still, many analysts suspect the two countries have a secret deal allowing them. Malik, the interior minister, said Pakistan's military was determined to finish off Pakistan's Taliban. ""It is a targeted law enforcement action against Baitullah Mehsud's group and it will continue till Baitullah Mehsud's group is eliminated forever,"" he said. Pakistan's record on putting pressure on the Taliban network is spotty. It has used both military action and truces to try to contain Mehsud over the years, but neither tactic seemed to work, despite billions in U.S. aid aimed at helping the Pakistanis tame the tribal areas. Mehsud was not that prominent a militant when the U.S. invaded Afghanistan in 2001 after the Sept. 11 attacks, according to Mahmood Shah, a former security chief for the tribal regions. In fact, he has struggled against such rivals as Abdullah Mehsud, an Afghan war veteran who had spent time in Guantanamo Bay. But a February 2005 peace deal with Mehsud appeared to give him room to consolidate and boost his troop strength. Within months of that accord, dozens of pro-government tribal elders in the region were gunned down on his command. In December 2007, Mehsud became the head of a new coalition called the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or Pakistan's Taliban movement. Under his guidance, the group killed hundreds of Pakistanis in suicide and other attacks. Analysts say the reason for Mehsud's rise in the militant ranks is his alliances with al-Qaida and other violent groups. U.S. intelligence has said al-Qaida has set up its operational headquarters in Mehsud's South Waziristan stronghold and neighboring North Waziristan. Mehsud has no record of attacking targets in the West, although he has threatened to attack Washington. However, he is suspected of being behind a 10-man cell arrested in Barcelona in January 2008 for plotting suicide attacks in Spain. Pakistan's former government and the CIA have named him as the prime suspect behind the December 2007 killing of Bhutto, the former Pakistani prime minister. He has denied a role. ___ Munir Ahmad reported from Islamabad.

12291,30036,10879,Aide says Pakistani Taliban leader Mehsud is dead,1725,Sister Umm Anwar,"{Source: CBSNews.com} Pakistani officials and a senior Taliban figure told CBS News on Friday that the militant group's highest-ranking commander in the country was killed in a CIA missile strike earlier in the week and that his body has been buried. Locals residents in the area of the strike, Pakistani intelligence officials and two senior figures from Mehsud's own Taliban faction confirmed the death of Baitullah Mehsud, reports CBS News' Maria Usman. They say he was killed in the suspected U.S. missile strike on his father-in-law's house. Maulvi Kifayatullah, head of Mehsud's Taliban faction for the Aurakzai agency, a region which sits next to the commander's home region of South Waziristan, confirmed the killing to Usman in a phone call. A second source, a subcommander in Mehsud's own region, also said the feared warlord was dead. The intelligence sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the militant commander has already buried in his ancestral graveyard in Nargasi village, in the South Waziristan region. One official told the Associated Press earlier Friday he had seen a classified intelligence report stating Mehsud was dead and buried, but that agents have not seen the body as the area is under Taliban control. CBS News correspondent Richard Roth reports that this is not the first time the leader of the Pakistani Taliban has been reported killed, but it is the first time there's been so much support for the claim. Still hedging the reports with caution, as previous reports that Mehsud had been killed or captured have proven inaccurate, Pakistan's Foreign Minister said Friday that, ""according to my intelligence information, the news about Baitullah Mehsud is true."" CBS News' Farhan Bokhari reported that the chief diplomat, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, told reporters that Pakistan was ""trying to get verification on the ground for 100 percent confirmation, but according to my information he has been taken out."" U.S. authorities were also trying to confirm whether Mehsud, who has led a violent campaign of suicide attacks and assassinations against Pakistan's government, was killed in the suspected CIA missile strike. Pakistan's Interior Minister, Rehman Malik, said earlier this week there was a ""strong possibility"" Mehsud died in the Aug. 5 strike - an assessment not disputed by a U.S. official speaking Thursday to CBS News. The U.S. official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was ""reason to believe"" the reports may be accurate, ""but it cannot be confirmed at this point."" A senior U.S. counterterrorism official told CBS News correspondent Kimberly Dozier Friday that American agencies will still press their Paksitani colleagues to obtain DNA confirmation of Mehsud's death. The official called it ""surprising"" that a prominent members of Mehsud's own group would give confirmation of his death, but added that ""there has been enough infighting over the past six months that the various internal and external rivals want the 'clean break' so they can position themselves."" Mehsud's apparent demise represents a landmark victory to Pakistani and U.S. efforts to eradicate the Taliban and al Qaeda. Mehsud has al Qaeda connections and has been suspected in the killing of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Pakistan views him as its top internal threat and has been preparing an offensive against him. The U.S. sees him as a danger to the war effort in Afghanistan, largely because of the threat he is believed to pose to nuclear-armed Pakistan. Bokhari reports that analysts say Mehsud had emerged as a major icon of extremist Islamic resistance and was thought by some to have as many as 20,000 militants under his command. The missile strike hit the home of Mehsud's father-in-law in Pakistan's South Waziristan tribal region early Wednesday. His second wife was also killed, according to intelligence officials. Taliban militants were quick to deny the rumors of Mehsud's death after the strike, but started to back down from their insistence that he was no where near the strike in the following days, completely reversing their claim on Friday. CBS News' Sami Yousafzai reports that, according to Taliban sources, a rare meeting of top aides was held Thursday, but it was unclear whether the meeting was called to select a new leader or pay tribute to Mehsud's wife. Under intense pressure from U.S. air strikes, Taliban commanders had ordered a halt to all high-level gatherings, making Thursday's meeting something of a mystery. The U.S. and Pakistan will conduct DNA testing on the body to try to confirm it is Mehsud, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing an unnamed U.S. defense official. The tests will use DNA samples taken from Mehsud's family members, and results could take anywhere from days to weeks, the newspaper reported. For years, the U.S. has considered Mehsud a lesser threat to its interests than some of the other Pakistani Taliban, their Afghan counterparts and al Qaeda, because most of his attacks were focused inside Pakistan, not against U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan. That view appeared to change in recent months as Mehsud's power grew and concerns mounted that increasing violence in Pakistan could destabilize the U.S. ally and threaten the entire region. In March, the State Department authorized a reward of up to $5 million for the militant chief. And increasingly, American missiles fired by unmanned drones have focused on Mehsud-related targets. While Mehsud's death will be a big blow to the Taliban in Pakistan, he has deputies who could take his place. Sources tell Usman that Taliban leaders are already considering three or four candidates to replace Mehsud, one of the most likely being his cousin and top aide, Hakimullah Mehsud. (CBS)CBS News' Khaled Wassef reports that Hakimullah Mehsud (at left) is the Taliban's commander for the Urakzai, Kurram, and Khyber tribal agencies. Hakimullah has purportedly been in charge of the Taliban's operations against NATO supply lines from Pakistan into Afghanistan. He made his first appearance before the media last November, when he gave a news conference to reporters in Peshawar. Whether the new leader, whomever it will be, can wreak as much havoc in Pakistan as Mehsud depends largely on how much pressure the Pakistani military continues to put on the Taliban network, especially in South Waziristan. Pakistan's record is spotty on that front. It has used both military action and truces to try to contain Mehsud over the years, but neither tactic seemed to work, despite billions in U.S. aid aimed at helping the Pakistanis tame the tribal areas. Mehsud was not that prominent a militant when the U.S. invaded Afghanistan in 2001 after the Sept. 11 attacks, according to Mahmood Shah, a former security chief for the tribal regions. In fact, Mehsud has struggled against such rivals as Abdullah Mehsud, an Afghan war veteran who had spent time in U.S. custody in Guantanamo Bay. A February 2005 peace deal with Mehsud appeared to give him room to consolidate and boost his troop strength tremendously, and within months dozens of pro-government tribal elders in the region were gunned down on his command. In December 2007, Mehsud became the head of a new coalition called the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or Pakistan's Taliban movement. Under Mehsud's guidance, the group has killed hundreds of Pakistanis in suicide and other attacks. He is believed to have as many as 20,000 fighters at his beck and call, among them a steady supply of suicide bombers. Analysts say the reason for Mehsud's rise in the militant ranks was his alliances with al Qaeda and other violent extremist groups. U.S. intelligence has said al Qaeda has set up its operational headquarters in Mehsud's South Waziristan stronghold and the neighboring North Waziristan tribal area. Mehsud has no record of attacking targets in the West, although he has threatened to attack Washington. However, he is suspected of being behind a 10-man cell arrested in Barcelona in January 2008 for plotting suicide attacks in Spain. Pakistan's former government and the CIA have named him as the prime suspect behind the December 2007 killing of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. He has denied a role. He also withstood threats from within Taliban ranks. A few weeks ago, Qari Zainuddin, the leader of a renegade Pakistani Taliban faction who had criticized Mehsud's tactics, was shot to death - allegedly on Mehsud's orders. In June of this year, Pakistan said it would launch an offensive against Mehsud in South Waziristan. In the weeks that have followed, the army has relied heavily on air strikes to target areas under Mehsud's control, but it has never quite gone full-scale with the offensive. Meantime, the missile strikes continued, raising speculation that the U.S. might get him first. Pakistan publicly opposes the missile strikes, saying they anger local tribes and make it harder for the army to operate. Still, many analysts suspect the two countries have a secret deal allowing the strikes. Taliban militants often blame Pakistani ""spies"" for helping the American intelligence agencies pinpoint their strikes",2009,08,07,2009-08-07 00:00:00.000,30028

There were rumours that Mehsud was among the four people killed in a drone attack in an area of Zangra after which he was buried in Nigosa. His younger wife, daughter of Malik Ikramuddin Mehsud, reportedly also died in the air strikes and four children were reportedly injured in the attack. “How could he die in the attack when he was not present in the house,” said a close aide to Baitullah, who called news agencies from an undisclosed location. The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) commander claimed that Baitullah was far away from the place where the drone struck the house of his father-in-law. He said that the Pakistani government had declared Baitullah dead twice in the past, but those claims proved untrue. “How could a person wanted by the Pakistani and US governments would like to stay at a place where the US spy planes fly round-the-clock and the Pakistani forces continuously target his positions,” he asked.

There were rumours that Mehsud was among the four people killed in a drone attack in an area of Zangra after which he was buried in Nigosa. His younger wife, daughter of Malik Ikramuddin Mehsud, reportedly also died in the air strikes and four children were reportedly injured in the attack. “How could he die in the attack when he was not present in the house,” said a close aide to Baitullah, who called news agencies from an undisclosed location. The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) commander claimed that Baitullah was far away from the place where the drone struck the house of his father-in-law. He said that the Pakistani government had declared Baitullah dead twice in the past, but those claims proved untrue. “How could a person wanted by the Pakistani and US governments would like to stay at a place where the US spy planes fly round-the-clock and the Pakistani forces continuously target his positions,” he asked http://theunjustmedia.com/",2009,08,08,2009-08-08 00:00:00.000,30028

12407,30229,10879,Aide says Pakistani Taliban leader Mehsud is dead,1725,Sister Umm Anwar,"{Source: Associated Press – 1 min ago} ISLAMABAD – A Taliban spokesman and a deputy to Baitullah Mehsud claimed Saturday that the Pakistani Taliban chief was not killed by a CIA missile strike, contradicting another aide who confirmed Mehsud's death a day earlier. The claims, made in calls to Pakistani and international media organizations, could undermine the growing confidence among U.S. and Pakistani officials that Mehsud died. They also could be tactical maneuvers to prevent defections as the Taliban leadership searches for a successor to Mehsud or even to delay a decision on naming an heir. Pakistani intelligence officials acknowledged Saturday that the missile strike said to have killed the Taliban chief was carried out with Islamabad's help, indicating growing coordination between the two countries despite Pakistan's official disapproval of the strikes. Mehsud deputy, Hakimullah, and Taliban spokesman Maulvi Umar each called two separate Associated Press reporters Saturday to say that Mehsud was alive. They pledged evidence of his continued existence would be brought forth in the coming days. The reports of his death ""are just to discourage and destroy the morale of the Taliban,"" Umar said. Umar said Mehsud was with his fighters ""sound and fit,"" and not even injured. He said Mehsud would not be provoked into coming out into the open so soon because that would make him a target. Hakimullah is one of the potential successors to lead the militant group. However, intelligence agents said it appears likely that Hakimullah may be passed over for the top position in favor of another Mehsud aide, Waliur Rehman. Asked if Mehsud could call AP, Hakimullah said it was not possible at the moment. And asked why he did not refute the reports of Mehsud's death earlier in the week, the militant did not answer. Mehsud's aide Kafayat Ullah told AP a day earlier that Mehsud was killed with one of his two wives Wednesday in his stronghold in the South Waziristan tribal region. ""I confirm that Baitullah Mehsud and his wife died in the American missile attack in South Waziristan,"" Taliban commander Kafayat Ullah told AP by telephone. A local tribesman, who also spoke on condition his name not be used, said Mehsud had been at his father-in-law's house being treated for kidney pain, and had been put on a drip by a doctor, when the missile struck. The tribesman claimed he attended the Taliban chief's funeral. Pakistani and U.S. officials said they were getting the same reports and were reasonably confident in them, but did not have forensic evidence such as a body for irrefutable confirmation. Mahmood Shah, a former security chief for the tribal regions, was skeptical about the Taliban's assertions Baitullah was alive, saying the claims could be part of a leadership struggle. ""If he was alive he could have spoken himself,"" Shah said. ""There is, I think, a struggle going on for the leadership, and Hakimullah Mehsud is one of the contenders,"" he added. Pakistan considered the al-Qaida-linked Mehsud its No. 1 internal threat. He was suspected in the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and numerous suicide attacks across Pakistan. The U.S. initially viewed him as less of a threat than other Taliban fighters, mainly because he tended to go after Pakistani targets instead of American and NATO troops in Afghanistan. That view appeared to change as Mehsud grew in strength. Two Pakistani intelligence officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media, said the CIA launched the missiles after Pakistan passed along a confirmed report that the militant chief was staying at his father-in-law's home. A video of the attack was shared with Pakistani authorities. In it, Mehsud's vehicle is seen parked inside a sprawling compound and Mehsud was also visible, said one of the intelligence officials. The official declined to give more specifics, such as exactly where Mehsud was. He said that intelligence reports from informants said Mehsud's body was mutilated, but did not say if the informants had seen the remains. Last year, a senior Pakistani intelligence official said Mehsud had died of kidney failure due to diabetes complications. But a Taliban spokesman and a doctor denied the report the same day and Mehsud re-emerged. Pakistan has routinely condemned the American missile strikes, saying they violate its sovereignty and anger the local population, especially when civilians are killed. Analysts suspect that public stance is simply a face-saving measure for the government, and that it secretly cooperating in the attacks. In any case, a strike that kills Mehsud would be a huge boon for the Pakistanis, and it might nudge them to go after militant leaders the U.S. sees as a greater threat to its interests in neighboring Afghanistan. Aside from Hakimullah and Waliur Rehman, potential successors to Mehsud include another aide, Azmat Ullah and Qari Hussain, known for training suicide bombers",2009,08,08,2009-08-08 00:00:00.000,30028

According to a foreign news agency, the comments by Wali-ur-Rehman add to a volley of unverifiable claims and counter-claims by the government and the Taliban that have surrounded the reported death of Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud in a U.S. missile attack on Wednesday. Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik had said on Saturday that Taliban commander Wali-ur-Rehman had been involved in a shootout with rival Hakimullah Mehsud, and that there were reports one of them died. Wali-ur-Rehman, speaking by telephone from an undisclosed location to a Reuters reporter who had spoken with him several times before, denied that any council meeting, or shura, had taken place to decide on a successor to Baitullah Mehsud. ""There are no differences. There was no fighting. We both are alive, and there was no special shura meeting,"" he said. Hakimullah Mehsud had earlier denied that Baitullah Mehsudhad been killed by the U.S. drone strike in the first place. Taliban commanders have said the government is fabricating reports of dissent within its ranks in order to promote division and undermine the movement. Hakimullah Mehsud would call journalists soon to prove he too was alive, Rehman said. ""He definitely will call you and tell you everything,"" he said. Western governments with troops in Afghanistan are watching to see if any new Pakistani Taliban leader would shift focus from fighting the Pakistani government and put the movement's weight behind the Afghan insurgency led by Mullah Mohammad Omar.

National security adviser: US believes Mehsud dead By ANNE GEARAN (AP) – 2 hours ago WASHINGTON — The United States is nearly certain the Pakistani Taliban's leader is dead, and there now is a leadership struggle within the terrorist group, White House national security adviser James Jones said Sunday. Claims and counterclaims about Baitullah Mehsud's fate have swirled since a CIA missile strike last Wednesday on his father-in-law's house in Pakistan's rugged, lawless tribal area. ""Mehsud was a very bad individual, a real thug,"" said Jones, who appeared on three Sunday talk shows. He said the U.S. ""put it in the 90 percent category"" that Meshud was killed. ""This is a big deal,"" he said. Pakistani authorities increasingly are convinced that Mehsud is dead. Government and intelligence officials, as well as some Taliban commanders, have said all indicators point to his death, but other Taliban commanders have vehemently denied that. Further muddying the waters, there were conflicting reports that a major fight had broken out between rival Taliban factions during a meeting, or shura, to select a replacement for Mehsud, and that one or two of the most likely contenders — Hakimullah and Waliur Rehman — had either been killed or wounded. Jones said he could not confirm the fight or its outcome, but he said a leadership fight may work to U.S. advantage. If true, the gunfight lends credence to the assertion that Mehsud, considered Pakistan's most dangerous man, had indeed been killed. ""Multiple sources are now confirming he's dead,"" including at least two Taliban commanders, army spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told The Associated Press. He said the reports of infighting were ""one of the biggest, latest indicators."" Jones agreed, and congratulated the Pakistani military for pressing the fight against the branch of the Taliban that lives inside Pakistan. The U.S. believes some of the worst violence in Afghanistan is directed from across the border in Pakistan. ""If there is dissension in the ranks and if in fact he is, as we think, dead, this is a positive indication that in Pakistan things are turning for the better,"" Jones said. He did not give details about the strike, which is part of a U.S. policy of cross-border attacks that is deeply unpopular with the Pakistani public. The Obama administration has continued the strikes even while trying to improve both the U.S. relationship with Pakistan's leaders and the image of the U.S. and its fight against terrorism. U.S. officials regularly point out that terrorism is a large and growing danger inside Pakistan that the country's own military is best placed to combat. Jones called Mehsud ""public enemy No. 1"" in his own country. Any succession battle for the top slot in Pakistan's Taliban was always likely to be brutal. Mehsud's Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan is not a single, cohesive group. Rather, it is more a loose alliance of tribal groups that often have disputes and power struggles between each other. So taking out the man who coordinated the factions could lead to fierce rivalry over who will succeed him. It could be in the interests of top commanders to deny their leader was dead until they could agree on who will replace him. Jones appeared on ""Fox News Sunday"" and NBC's ""Meet the Press.""",2009,08,09,2009-08-09 00:00:00.000,30189

Plz inform me if the news of his Martyredom is true as i m very concerned abt him............ Taliban leaders reported killed who later resurfaced: Baitullah Mehsud: On Sept. 30, 2008, several major news sources reported that Pakistani Taliban leader and South Waziristan warlord Baitullah Mehsud died of natural causes related to kidney problems. The Long War Journal was very skeptical that Baitullah was dead, and intelligence sources said he was alive. On Oct. 1, the Taliban denied the report. Baitullah was seen visiting villages in South Waziristan to celebrate Eid-al-Fitr on Oct. 4. Baitullah was also thought to have been killed in an airstrike earlier in 2009. Mullah Sangeen Zadran: Pakistani intelligence sources claimed that Sangeen, the right-hand man of Haqqani Network military commander Siraj, was killed along with Baitullah and Qari Hussain during an airstrike at the funeral of one of Baitullah's commanders. The Taliban quickly debunked these claims. Faqir Mohammed: The Pakistani military claimed Faqir Mohammed, the deputy commander of the Pakistani Taliban and the group's leader in the Bajaur tribal agency, was killed in a battle in Bajaur in August 2008. A Taliban spokesman immediately denied the report, and Faqir appeared in front of the media a day later to dispute the claim of his death. The Pakistani military also claimed that Faqir's son, Abdullah Mohammed, was killed, although no proof of his death has been offered. Mullah Fazlullah: Several times during the spring 2009 offensive in Swat, the Pakistani military and the interior ministry claimed Mullah Fazlullah was killed. Fazlullah's aides denied the reports, and in July 2009, Fazlullah was later heard giving a speech on the radio. Omar Khalid: The military said Omar Khalid, the commander of Taliban forces in the Mohmand tribal agency, was killed during operations in the region in January 2009. Taliban commanders denied the claims, and Khalid later spoke to the media. Ibn Amin: The Pakistani military and the interior ministry claimed Ibn Amin, the leader of al Qaeda's paramilitary brigade in Swat, was killed in May 2009 during the Swat offensive. Amin later resurfaced and took control of the Taliban forces in Swat after Shah Doran, Fazlullah's deputy and Swat's military commander, was killed. Doran is the only senior Swat Taliban leader killed during the three-month battle. Qari Hussain: The Pakistani military claimed Qari Hussain, a senior lieutenant to Baitullah Mehsud who ran a suicide bomber nursery in South Waziristan, was killed during operations in January 2008. Hussain held a press conference in South Waziristan on May 23, 2008, and mocked the Pakistani military. ""I am alive, don't you see me?"" Hussain said. Maulvi Omar: The Pakistani military claimed Omar, who is the spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, was killed during an October 2008 airstrike in the Badano region in Taliban-controlled Bajaur. Omar later appeared on television. The Long War Journal was skeptical of the reports of Omar's death.

Maulan Nur Syed denied this was linked in any way to claims Baitullah Mehsud was killed in a US missile strike on Wednesday in a remote tribal area. Both the US and Pakistan earlier said their intelligence suggested Baitullah Mehsud was killed in the attack. There were also reports of a major gun battle between potential successors to Baitullah Mehsud after the strike. On Sunday, Maulana Nur Syed told the BBC the Pakistani Taliban leader had not been at the house that was attacked by the US missile. But it is thought that by making this statement, the Taliban are preparing the ground for an announcement that Pakistan's most wanted man is in fact dead, the BBC's Orla Guerin in Islamabad says. '90% certainty' Earlier, Pakistani officials said they had ""credible evidence"" that Baitullah Mehsud had been killed. But senior Taliban commander Hakimullah Mehsud then contacted the BBC to say his chief was alive and well. Officials in Islamabad later said that Hakimullah was himself one of those killed in a fight over succession in South Waziristan. The BBC's Aleem Maqbool, in Islamabad, says the situation is very unclear and information is based on rumours from deep inside militant territory in north-west Pakistan. In Washington, US National Security Adviser Jim Jones put he level of US certainty that Baitullah Mehsud had been killed ""in the 90% category"". The Pakistani interior minister have challenged the Taliban to prove its leaders are still alive. But Taliban commanders have dismissed this as a ploy to flush them out into the open.

Government officials in Pakistan said a missile killed the commander when it hit the house of his father-in-law in Pakistan's South Waziristan tribal region early on Wednesday. Mehsud has been accused of a string of assassinations, suicide attacks and beheadings and the bombing which killed Pakistan's former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. His death would be seen as a major victory for US attempts to eradicate the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The White house said there was ""pretty conclusive"" evidence Mehsud was dead. Jim Jones, a US national security adviser said: ""We put it in the 90 per cent category."" However, Mehsud's deputy, Noor Said, claimed a video would prove the commander was alive. Taliban also rejected reports from Pakistan intelligence officials that the movement had been racked by in-fighting in the wake of the strike with a shoot out between rivals to succeed Mehsud. Wali-ur-Rehman, denied reports he had been involved in a shoot-out with Hakimullah Mehsud for the Pakistani Taliban leadership. He also denied that any tribal council meeting, or shura, had taken place to decide a successor to Baitullah. He said: ""There are no differences. There was no fighting. We both are alive, and there was no special shura meeting."" Western governments with troops in Afghanistan are watching to see if any new Pakistani Taliban leader would shift the focus from fighting the Pakistani government and put the movement's weight behind the Afghan insurgency led by Mullah Mohammad Omar. ************************************************** ************************ I cant quit laughing at the kafir propoganda machine, Look what they stated about our beloved brother last year(which by the way, this is a claim they made about our beloved sheikh Osama Bin laden also a few years back).....This story is dated, but it shows how they manipulate the media to spread their lies.............................................. ............................................... {Published: 3:25PM BST 01 Oct 2008} Taliban leader in Pakistan, Baitullah Mehsud, 'dies from kidney failure' Mehsud was accused by Pakistan and US intelligence of being responsible for the assassination of the former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. Rumours of his death are circulating in Pakistan. The former fitness instructor turned terrorist leader has diabetes and has been reported to be unwell for months. Speculation is mounting that Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani wing of the Taliban, has died from kidney failure. Mehsud, in his mid-thirties, rose suddenly from obscurity possibly with the support of a faction of Pakistan's shadowy ISI military intelligence that has secretly backed the Taliban. However, his doctor said he had an unspecified kidney problem, but that he was alive. Mehsud has denied involvement in the attack on Bhutto as she left an election rally in the city of Rawalpindi on Dec. 27, which her widower, Mr Zardari, has blamed on Pakistan's establishment. Officials have accused Mehsud, the head of the country's umbrella Taliban organisation, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), of being behind a wave of suicide attacks in Pakistan since the middle of last year. Mixed reports surrounding the Taliban leader's death came as American missiles, fired from an unmanned drone aircraft, killed at least six people in a Pakistani tribal region near the Afghan border. The missiles struck the home of a local Taliban commander before midnight on Tuesday near Mir Ali, a town in North Waziristan. ""We have reports of five dead including foreign militants,"" said an intelligence official. The strike took place shortly after tribesmen shot at three drones circling the village of Khusali Toorikhel in North Waziristan, a known haunt of Taliban and Al-Qaeda militants. Tension between Pakistan and the United States has escalated since Washington stepped up attacks on Pakistani territory after a new civilian government came to power in March. American forces have carried out seven missile strikes fired from pilotless drones and a commando raid on the Pakistani side of the border in the past month. Last Thursday, Pakistani and US troops exchanged fire along the border after two US military helicopters came under fire. Though both sides played down the incident later, Pakistan contended that the US helicopters had entered Pakistani territory while Washington argued they had not left Afghanistan. America has expressed frustration at the continued support for the Taliban by Pakistan's military intelligence agency. On Tuesday the Afghan head of intelligence told Al Jazeera news broadcaster that Pakistan did not need a military operation to tackle the Taliban but only to ""soft knock their houses"" in the Pakistani cities of Quetta and Peshawar. President Asif Ali Zardari has vowed zero tolerance against violations of Pakistan's sovereignty. Washington claimed to respect Pakistani sovereignty on Monday in a joint statement with Pakistan following talks between the US deputy secretary of state, John Negroponte, and Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. ""The United States affirmed its support for Pakistan's sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity,"" according to the joint statement issued by the State Department. However, it is believed that a secret deal exists permitting missile strikes against foreign fighters. The former foreign minister, Khurshid Kasuri, revealed at the weekend that a deal allowed for ""limited"" American action on Pakistani soil.",2009,08,10,2009-08-10 00:00:00.000,30189

He maintained that Baitullah was following in the footsteps of Osama bin Laden and Afghan Taliban leader Mulla Mohammad Omar by keeping quiet and avoiding limelight as part of a strategy to avoid harm. He also denying that a meeting of the TTP Shura, or council, was being held to choose Baitullah’s successor, he said there was no need for it as the TTP head was neither dead nor injured. He argued that Baitullah was not the sort of person who would stay at his father-in-law’s house and become the target of a drone attack. He ridiculed the media for reporting Baitullah’s death and creating hype about something that did not take place. source: unjustmedia",2009,08,10,2009-08-10 00:00:00.000,30189

12897,31122,10598,Terrorism raids in Melbourne 04/08/2009,1380,bint hamid,"Quote: But one thing stands out: there is, literally, no smoking gun. No guns at all. If there were, the leak-prone federal police could not have kept it secret this long. Quote: It seems the crew of labourers and taxi drivers (and one kickboxer) alleged to be wannabe terrorists had not obtained any weapons - let alone the murderous firepower of semi-automatic assault rifles and pistols used in last November's Mumbai attacks. The explosive black market http://www.smh.com.au/national/the-e...y.html?page=-1 August 8, 2009 There was a missing key element in arrests this week of alleged wannabe terrorists. And it's one of the easier deficiencies to overcome, writes Andrew Rule. FOR seven months, surveillance experts watched every move and monitored every phone call made by the Somali and Lebanese men suspected of plotting a terrorist attack on Sydney's Holdsworthy army base. The watchers had little choice. Police and security organisations cannot ignore information from undercover sources that have infiltrated groups with the potential to produce terrorist sympathisers, violent crimes and mass murder. Before dawn last Tuesday, police raided 19 houses and arrested four men. The courts will eventually weigh the evidence against them. But one thing stands out: there is, literally, no smoking gun. No guns at all. If there were, the leak-prone federal police could not have kept it secret this long. Front-page images of grim-faced police carrying out armloads of weaponry was the picture opportunity the publicity-hungry Feds would have loved - and their dour Victorian counterparts would not have minded, either. However briefly, Victoria's police chief, Simon Overland, and his federal counterparts might have seen eye to eye. But it didn't happen. It seems the crew of labourers and taxi drivers (and one kickboxer) alleged to be wannabe terrorists had not obtained any weapons - let alone the murderous firepower of semi-automatic assault rifles and pistols used in last November's Mumbai attacks. The extent of police evidence seems to be that the suspects discussed acquiring weapons of the sort used by sporting shooters. It will be months, even years, before a court decides whether the alleged terrorists planned anything more sinister than making threats, but one thing is clear: despite tough gun laws imposed since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, any would-be terror group could arm itself without going far from home. Informed sources say one of Australia's best-kept secrets is a thriving arms blackmarket. Like drugs, the guns are out there. All it takes to get them is contacts - and plenty of cash. TWO months ago, within shooting distance of some of this week's raids in Melbourne's northern suburbs, an underground arms dealer with Hells Angels connections was offering for sale two boxes of hand grenades. Each box contained 25 grenades, described by sources as ''the copper wire models used in Vietnam''. The price? A cool $250 each - $12,500 the lot. Even allowing for the middleman's mark-up, it's easy money (or drugs) for the soldier who stole them from an army base. The one consolation, says a source, is that buyers of such blackmarket power tend to be those ''who just buy them to have them''. Outlaw bikie gangs tend to hoard such deadly military hardware and trade it among their members. But they also exploit rising prices caused by tougher gun laws to supply small arms, especially handguns, to criminals and a subculture of disgruntled shooters willing to flout the law. On the fringes of this group are a few serving or former soldiers, prison officers and police. Bikies are better known for making and dealing amphetamines but their link with guns goes back further and runs deeper. When police raid bikie gangs looking for drugs, they do not always find them - but they usually find firearms. In one raid, a policeman accidentally kicked a step, which fell apart to reveal five handguns. In another, police found a cannon, two machine-guns and night-vision goggles. These are the few visible signs of a thriving underground arms market increasingly linked to ethnic crime groups - especially Sydney Lebanese gangsters in the drug trade. The authorities, including the Australian Crime Commission, might not broadcast it but they fear the Lebanese connection could let military-style weapons fall into the hands of radical groups. The fear is justified, say our sources. In the seven months that police have been monitoring the alleged al-Shabab terrorist group, several lethal weapons have sold for big prices in Melbourne alone. The most worrying consignment hawked around Melbourne's northern suburbs recently was several fully automatic military assault weapons - Colt AR15s - for $7000 to $8000 each. A 10-shot semi-automatic Browning pistol, with US military stamp, was shown to prospective buyers. Worth about $1400 on the legitimate market, it reportedly sold for $5000. A $7000 offer from Sydney was rejected, presumably because they would have to deliver it here. Three World War II vintage Tommy Guns were reportedly bought by Hells Angels, the acknowledged gun-running experts. Many original rebel motorcycle gang members were former military men too familiar with guns to live without them. Australian Hells Angels brought back the recipe for amphetamines from the US in the 1980s and bikies have dominated the ''speed'' trade since. But guns, their other cash cow, are still mostly imported. For buyers with enough cash - $5000 to $7000 - high-powered handguns can be smuggled to order, says one source. ''Berettas are the big thing, and Glocks are the next, because they both have 15-shots.'' Sometimes there are crates of handguns and discount buys of five for $20,000. According to underworld sources and former police, the most common smuggling ruse is to hide pistols in engine blocks and mechanical parts imported from the US. ''Bikies are constantly involved with cars and trucks. They loved bringing in big cars like Cadillacs to restore and drive around,'' says a former drug squad detective. ''They would fill the sump with stripped-down pistols.'' Sniffer dogs can't detect them if the gun parts are covered in oil and X-rays won't find them inside engine blocks. Barely one in 20 shipping containers is searched and standards are even more lax at smaller ports. Despite tougher laws, many thousands of guns have slipped through loopholes and onto the blackmarket, says a licensed gun dealer who insisted on anonymity. A glaring error in legislation before 2003 meant pistols with barrels removed could be sold as ''parts'' without restriction. Unscrupulous NSW dealers bought up thousands of pistols from interstate dealers with the barrels removed, then other dealers would buy up the ''spare'' barrels - which would obviously be sold on to unlicensed cash buyers who would assemble complete pistols in a few minutes. Too easy. Another racket to foil the gun laws was to spot-weld pistol barrels, ostensibly to disable them so they could be sold as harmless collectibles. But the welding was done so that any trades person could unpick it and restore the weapon to working order. ''I know that 28,000 handguns were taken to NSW and Queensland and 'vanished' like that in about five years,'' the dealer says. And the legacy of previously lax laws in Queensland meant thousands of automatic assault rifles were unaccounted for in that state, where they were popular for shooting feral pigs. Cheap Chinese versions of the ubiquitous and lethal AK-47 assault rifle were sold ''off the back of trucks'' in rural Queensland for years before the laws were changed. ''If you want one, all you have to do is send someone around the bush in Queensland, offering to pay cash. There are thousands of them out there.'' PILFERING military armories has been a secret racket for decades. Occasionally, the public hears about it but mostly the authorities don't like to publicise thefts: a military that cannot guard its own weapons doesn't inspire confidence and is an embarrassment to the government of the day. In 1978, for instance, professional criminals with inside information broke into a commando reserve armoury at Melbourne's Williamstown and took what a retired gunman describes as ''two truckloads'' of machine-guns - and, more seriously, deadly Claymore anti-personnel mines, complete with written instructions on their use. The heist was too big to be made public. Behind it, say underworld sources, was a notorious drug dealer and killer, now dead. According to the source, an army brigadier and colonel negotiated via a series of middlemen - starting with a former soldier - to quietly secure the return of the Claymore mines. But dozens of sub-machine guns stayed in the underworld. Some were subsequently handed in to police in return for favourable treatment over other crimes. ''But the rest are still out there,'' the source says. Similarly, says a licensed gun dealer, there was little publicity about a consignment of Glock semi-automatic pistols that went missing in transit in Sydney a few years ago. Ordered for the NSW police, they had ''NSW'' stamped on the butt - which was why dealers and police nationwide were asked to quietly check for the prefix on any Glocks they saw. How many? ''It was hush hush. I have heard figures as high as 1000, but it was probably more than 200,'' the dealer says. The sinister aspect of the heist was that it was obviously an inside job, as the entire container went missing from a ''secure'' area. It was apparently placed in a blind spot, away from security cameras. There are other blind spots in the system - such as the courtesy that visiting US sailors can bypass Customs. For diplomatic reasons, authorities deny or ignore the reality that some US sailors routinely smuggle handguns. On November 12, 1998, the huge aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln anchored in the Derwent River off Hobart and most of its 5500 sailors went ashore over five days. One group carried a wooden crate through the rudimentary ''beach guard'' on Princes Wharf, hailed a taxi and went to a nightclub for an arranged meeting. In the box were 40 new Colt .45 calibre semi-automatic pistols, then the standard US military sidearm. Not only lethal handguns, these were prized collectors' items commanding a premium that made the crate worth more than $100,000 on the blackmarket. Today, they would be worth up to three times as much, an indication of how the blackmarket has been supercharged by drug money. Although smuggling guns is an easy way for American sailors (and soldiers) to raise local currency, the aircraft carrier crew was not after money this time. As part of a plan, it swapped the crate of pistols for another crate holding a pair of young Tasmanian devils, trapped a few days before near Richmond, east of Hobart. Americans are fascinated by the animals because of the popularity of the Warner Bros cartoon character Taz. The devils were smuggled onto the ship. And the pistols? Almost all of them were taken to the mainland and sold, not all to active criminals. A former policeman, posted to the Melbourne docks to protect US ships from anti-nuclear protesters in the mid-1980s, vouches for the story. He recalls several colleagues swapping their police jackets for new pistols taken from another ship's armoury. ''The first time I went was for the USS Sterett. For some reason the crew were mad on collecting jackets everywhere they went. Obviously the armoury officer had done a deal with the sailors, because they would take your jacket, then direct you to the armoury guy and he would give you the pistol,'' said the former policeman. ''The funny thing was that every time a [US] warship came into port after that, cops would be running around collecting jackets to swap for pistols. They must have got dozens.'' US Navy ships have visited Australian ports only rarely since September 11, 2001. But plenty of cruise ships and freighters do. Somehow, somewhere, illegal guns flow in unchecked, joining a burgeoning blackmarket milieu of weapons that vanish from Australian army depots. The question for authorities is how many have found their way into the hands of individuals more dangerous than gangsters and bikies.",2009,08,12,2009-08-12 00:00:00.000,29204

12911,31155,10907,"Baitullah Mehsud is alive, claims Hakeemullah Mehsud",275,bark2512,"But... Baitullah Mahsood is Alive and Well in Pakistan Sha'aban 20, 1430 A.H, August 12, 2009 By Abdullah Al-Wazir In continuing of this independent investigative report which I am undertaking, and based upon our own private sources in Pakistan, we have received more clarification and information yesterday about the confusion regarding this strange matter which explains what caused the Pakistan authorities in Islamabad to spread this rumor of the death of Baitullah Mahsood, the leader of Taliban Pakistan. Our sources in Pakistan stated that a team consisting of US and Pakistani intelligence personnel planned and implemented a joint operation to wipe out Baitullah Mahsood in his stronghold of South Waziristan. In summary, the plan was to send various teams of intelligence agents inside South Waziristan, which then snuck in and focused on specific areas in the depths of the province, in order to track and locate the movements of Baitullah Mahsood and then to take him out. US spy planes were to provide further information about his whereabouts, and they could also carry out the role of wiping him out from the sky if the situation arose. However, after one month, these reconnaissance teams and spy planes utterly failed in locating the whereabouts of Baitullah Mahsood in the province! This was strengthened by the suspicions of the intelligence teams surrounding the death of Baitullah Mahsood, due to previous intelligence reports which stated that Baitullah Mahsood’s health was ailing and that he was suffering from some chronic illnesses. Our sources in Pakistan stated that the intelligence team changed their strategy into one which ascertained the condition of Baitullah Mahsood. One of the key elements of this plan was to spread the rumor of the death of Baitullah Mahsood in the media, because the US and Pakistani intelligence agencies believe Baitullah Mahsood to be a person who likes to show himself in the media. This will encourage him, if he is indeed alive, to come out in the open in the media to dispel the rumor of his death himself. In turn, this would aid in tracking his location! When US spy planes conducted airstrikes against one of the houses in South Waziristan at Fajr time last Wednesday, the US and Pakistan intelligence team magnified the affair, and due to this, they tried to spread this rumor of the death of Baitullah Mahsood as much as they could. They even used some defeatists who call themselves Taliban, such as the so-called Turkistan Baitni and others, in order to give this rumor some semblance of truth. They then announced that a Shura meeting was held in order to choose the next leader, and they extended their lie even more, saying that an armed conflict arose over the position of leadership. However, our sources in Pakistan have confirmed that all this information is fabricated without no basis whatsoever! Our sources in Pakistan added, quoting Taliban Pakistan: Many tried to convince Mahsood to come out in the open, but Baitullah Mahsood is not so easy. Rather he is shrewd and knows the plots of the enemy well, dealing with them with the clever leadership. His associated have promised to release a video tape of Baitullah Mahsood soon. I asked our sources in Pakistan to further clarify the health of Baitullah Mahsood, because I understood from a previous telephone conversation that he was in good health, as there some reports which state that Baitullah Mahsood suffers from some chronic illnesses despite his young age. Is he in good health or is he sick? Summary: Baitullah Mahsood is alive and well in Pakistan, and his group will soon release a video tape of him. The adamancy of the Pakistani authorities in Islamabad of their claim of the death of Baitullah Mahsood in those airstrikes has no meaning, especially when these authorities have not provided any evidence to support its claim! There is strong coordination between US and Pakistani intelligence which has reached the extent that they now carry out joint operations inside Pakistan! The Pakistani authorities allow US spy planes to use Pakistan airspace to carry out air assaults inside Pakistani territory which lead to the destruction of many civilians, as we all see. This type of propaganda war used by the intelligence agencies against its enemies, in my opinion, is a gamble through which they try to achieve speedy results. If it works, it will have its dangerous results upon regimes and governments, and the enemy groups which are targeted may even self-destruct in a second. But what are the results if these claims fail to achieve their goals? I believe that it will be a great setback and a huge blow which US and Pakistani intelligence will suffer from for a while to come, especially since Taliban Pakistan exposed this plot which sought to wipe out Baitullah Mahsood! We will bring more details and information as they appear, Allah willing. May Allah guide us to that which He loves and is pleased with Submitted by a Mujahid",2009,08,13,2009-08-13 00:00:00.000,30189

Samir Khan is back with his “Ignored Puzzle Pieces of Knowledge” website 2. His fly-by-night jihadist media operation, Al-Fursan Media, just released ‘Jihad Recollections’ – Issue 3 I urge our national-level leaders to think very hard about this magazine. It has become more than a free-speech issue – it is a national-security issue. This is the most advanced English-language jihadist publication currently in production. The authors know the movement as well or better than any government counterterrorism analyst. They are using this magazine not just to share thoughts but to actively steer and guide English-speaking Jihobbyists who do not have the kinds of local resources or teachers down the right path. This journal is designed to fulfill Abu Musab al-Suri’s call for global resistance through individual terrorism that is grounded in self-styled education made possible by educational materials. In other words, these magazine are a curricula for would-be Jihadis – it’s a course of instruction for Jihobbyists. What I’ve found is that they are highly nuanced about the Al-Qaida personalities, internal discussions, emerging trends, ideological points of vulnerability, core doctrines, needs of the movement, etc.. That means that they are getting more bang for their proverbial buck with every al-Qaida release that comes out. A few years ago, the English-language jihobbyist movement was sloppy – unable to discriminate about the high-brow stuff versus the snuff. Now, thanks to publications like this, the English-language jihobby movement is directly tracking with (albeit a few weeks behind) the Arabic jihadi world. Here’s my conclusion: the USG can not allow this kind of growth in jihadi sophistication to continue unabated in the United States. This is incitement of terrorism, no matter how many exculpatory qualifications they load up in their websites. It is a call to Americans, Canadians, Brits, Aussies and others not just to be smarter about al-Qaida, but to find new ways to BE AL-QAIDA. I’ll be reviewing some of the articles on the blog as soon as I make my final push on the big project I’ve been working on (hence the slow postings lately).

The gunfight is taking place near a Rafah mosque and both sides are making use of mortar fire. At least 15 people were reportedly wounded in the shootout. The Gaza Strip is an Islamic emirate, local Salafi leader Abdul Latif Musa told worshippers during a prayer session earlier, slamming Hamas' conduct in Gaza and pledging his supporters' allegiance to al-Qaeda. ""We belong to al-Qaeda and our leader is Osama Bin Laden,"" said Musa, considered the leader of Gaza's Salafi branch. In his sermon, Musa criticized Hamas' attitude, arguing that it is not sufficiently Islamic and noting that his supporters are making an effort to impose Islamic law in the Strip. He said that Hamas presents an Islamic veneer but adopts what amounts to secular policy. ""It's not implementing Islamic law and prefers to meet with Congress members and with Blair and Carter,"" he said. ""Should Hamas choose the way of Allah and the way of Jihad, we shall be its servants, but if they try to take over our mosques, we'll cut off their arms."" Musa declared that his supporters are willing to fight Hamas, and charged the group with seizing weapons worth $120,000 from his group. ""We will hurt those who hurt us,"" he said.

13073,31412,11207,Clashes between HAMAS & Jund Ansar Allah kill 24,10,Asadullah Alshishani,"GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip – Islamic radicals from an al-Qaida-inspired group battled Hamas security in the Gaza Strip Friday in a shootout that killed five people. The fighting began when Hamas forces surrounded a mosque in the southern Gaza town of Rafah where about 100 members of Jund Ansar Allah, or the Soldiers of the Companions of God, were holed up, including some armed with suicide belts, according to residents of the area. The confrontation was triggered when the leader of the group defied Gaza's Hamas rulers by declaring in a Friday prayer sermon that the territory was an Islamic emirate. Jund Ansar Allah and a number of other small, shadowy radical groups seek to enforce an even stricter version of Islamic law in Gaza and have criticized Hamas for not doing so. They are also upset that the Hamas regime has honored a cease-fire with Israel for the past seven months. Hamas has said it seeks to set an example and does not impose its views on others. It also says its violent struggle is against Israel, not the Western world. The hard-line groups are perhaps the most serious opposition to Hamas since it seized control of Gaza and ousted its rivals in the Fatah movement in a five-day civil war in June 2007. The leader of Jund Ansar Allah, Abdel-Latif Moussa, warned Hamas forces against trying to enter the mosque compound. ""If Hamas does that, it will be their end,"" he said. Shortly after, a gunbattle broke out between the militants inside the mosque and Hamas forces surrounding it. Gaza health officials said five people were killed and 50 wounded in the exchange of fire. A least one of the casualties was a senior Hamas security officer, officials said. Hamas security later raided the mosque. Jund Ansar Allah first came to public attention in June after it claimed responsibility for a failed attempt to attack Israel from Gaza on horseback. The group claims inspiration from al-Qaida, but no ties have been confirmed. In July, three Muslim extremists from the group holed themselves up in a building in southern Gaza, surrendering to Hamas police only after a lengthy standoff. It is unclear how many members Jund Ansar Allah or other similar extremist groups in Gaza have.",2009,08,14,2009-08-14 00:00:00.000,31383

13094,31439,11207,Clashes between HAMAS &amp; Jund Ansar Allah kill 24,30,Ibrahim AbdulWahid,"Gunfight breaks out at Gaza mosque Abdul Latif Musa, centre, demanded that Hamas implement a stricter interpretation of sharia [AFP] At least six people have been killed in violent clashes in the Gaza Strip after members of al-Jamaa al-Salafiya al-Jihadya in Palestine called for an ""Islamic emirate"" to be established in the occupied Palestinian territories. Nearly 50 other people were injured, eight critically, after midday prayers on Friday as armed men from the group fought Hamas security services in Rafah, close to the border with Egypt, medics said. Al Jazeera's Ayman Mohyeldin, reporting from Gaza, said that police had surrounded the Ibn Taymiya mosque in the town of Rafah after Abdul Latif Musa, a local imam, had made the proclamation during Friday prayers. ""About 50 or so supporters of the sheikh are believed to be inside the mosque and are refusing to hand themselves over to the Hamas authorities,"" he said. Heavy gunfire was heard around the mosque as the siege continued into the night, witnesses said. Sharia demand Al-Jamaa al-Salafiya al-Jihadya in Palestine (The Jihadist Salafist Group in Palestine) seeks a Palestinian legal system based purely on the sharia - Islamic law - and accuses Hamas of being too liberal. The group is said to have threatened to burn down internet cafes and to demand greater modesty on Gaza beaches. ""We are today proclaiming the creation of an Islamist emirate in the Gaza Strip"" Abdul Latif Musa, leader of Al-Jamaa al-Salafiya al-Jihadya in Palestine ""We are today proclaiming the creation of an Islamist emirate in the Gaza Strip,"" Musa had told worshippers at a Rafah mosque earlier, according to witnesses. Musa said that if Hamas were to implement sharia he would immediately instruct his followers to comply with the movement's instructions. An audience of several hundred men filled the mosque as Musa spoke, cheering and shouting in response to his address. A spokesperson for the Hamas-run interior ministry dismissed Musas's comments and described him as mentally unstable. In a statement, the ministry warned that those violating the law would be pursued and dealt with by the law. ""Everyone outside the law and carrying arms in order to spread chaos will be pursued and arrested,"" it said. The ministry of religious affairs has previously asked Musa to resign his post, but he has repeatedly refused. Foreign fighters Mohyeldin said: ""It is important to put this situation into the context of the discussion that has been going on here over the past week, and in fact for some time now. Heavily armed men accompanied Musa as he addressed worshippers at the mosque [AFP] ""There has been some criticism that Gaza has become a bastion or a safe place for a lot of foreign fighters ... and that is something that many here, in particular from Hamas, believe undermines Hamas's ability to rule."" Earlier on Friday, Ismail Haniyah, the de facto prime minister in Gaza, rejected Israeli allegations that non-Palestinians who had fought in Iraq and Afghanistan were crossing into from Egypt in order to set up bases in the territory. ""Such groups do not exist on the soil of the Gaza Strip ... there are no fighters in Gaza except Gazan fighters,"" he said. Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas official, said that Musa's group, which two months ago attempted horseback attack on an Israeli base, ""has no affiliation with foreign groups"".

13099,31445,11207,Clashes between HAMAS &amp; Jund Ansar Allah kill 24,10,Asadullah Alshishani,"At Least 13 now killed, including a HAMAS commander and young girl. Unconfirmed reports about of the Sheikh's martyrdom GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip – Islamic radicals from an al-Qaida-inspired group battled Hamas security in the Gaza Strip Friday in shootouts that killed at least 13 people. The fighting began when Hamas forces surrounded a mosque in the southern Gaza town of Rafah where about 100 members of Jund Ansar Allah, or the Soldiers of the Companions of God, were holed up, including some armed with suicide belts and rifles, according to residents of the area. The confrontation was triggered when the leader of the group defied Gaza's Hamas rulers by declaring in a Friday prayer sermon that the territory was an Islamic emirate. Jund Ansar Allah and a number of other small, shadowy radical groups seek to enforce an even stricter version of Islamic law in Gaza and have criticized Hamas for not doing so. They are also upset that the Hamas regime has honored a cease-fire with Israel for the past seven months. Hamas has said it seeks to set an example and does not impose its views on others. It also says its violent struggle is against Israel, not the Western world. The more radical groups' calls for global Jihad undermines Hamas' attempt to appear more moderate to Western eyes. The hard-line groups are perhaps the most serious opposition Hamas has faced since it seized control of Gaza and ousted its rivals in the Fatah movement in a five-day, bloody civil war in June 2007. The leader of Jund Ansar Allah, Abdel-Latif Moussa, warned Hamas forces against trying to enter the mosque compound. ""If Hamas does that, it will be their end,"" he said. Shortly afterward, a gunbattle broke out between the militants inside the mosque and Hamas forces surrounding it. Hamas officers then raided the mosque. The group's leader had already fled the mosque, and Hamas forces surrounded his house later and waged another gunbattle with his men. A large explosion was heard from Moussa's home late Friday, and the house partially collapsed, witnesses and security officials reported. It was unclear whether the explosion was set off by Hamas forces or militants with explosives holed up inside. Hamas has closed off the area and ambulances have been unable to access the scene of the fighting. At least 13 people were killed in both gunbattles, including a senior Hamas official and an 11-year-old girl, according to Gaza health official Moaiya Hassanain. Over 150 people were wounded, including 29 in serious condition, many of whom were civilians caught in the crossfire, Hassanain said. Hamas government spokesman Taher Nunu said the Hamas leadership was engaging in an operation against ""outlaws"" and called on Moussa's followers to surrender to the authorities. Jund Ansar Allah first came to public attention in June after it claimed responsibility for a failed attempt to attack Israel from Gaza on horseback. The group claims inspiration from al-Qaida, but no ties have been confirmed. In July, three Muslim extremists from the group holed themselves up in a building in southern Gaza, surrendering to Hamas police only after a lengthy standoff. It is unclear how many members Jund Ansar Allah or other similar extremist groups have in Gaza.",2009,08,14,2009-08-14 00:00:00.000,31383

And they betrayed the Islamic state so badly, May Allah curse them. And their contest against the confederacy of Salman bin Abdul Aziz and his tribal awakening project became apparent. Therefore the confederacy of Qatar-Nayif expanded and the rest of the ""resistance"" groups that bear ""Islamic"" motto joind it. And the enemy of Allah, Prince Salman's approach is apparently secular. He is the one who owns a big media network, including the Al-Arabiyyah channel. He owns newspapers and liberal writers, such as Abdur-Rahmaan Al-Rashid and his ilk, including their media, newspapers and magazines, so he presented himself to the Americans as a man who has a big influence in public opinion, and that he would change the Islamic approach in the region in the future. At the same time, what weakens him is the fact that his ways do not affect the ""extremists"" (as they name them), yet Muhammad bin Nayif was professionally more adept in this regard, may Allah curse all of them. So the contest increased among the alliances of Tawagheet, and Salman tried to cause secessions inside the confederacy of Qatar-Nayif, and this resulted in divisions inside the Islamic Army, as it is known. Salman gained some leaders of the Islamic Army for his confederacy, such as: ""Abu Al-Abid"" and ""Abu Azzam At-Tamimi"". And to prove their rivalry for power and exploiting the hired media, just look at the Al-Jazeera channel. It fights the awakening project, because it belongs to Salman and not the project of its Al-Thani masters. At the same time, it praises other groups such as the Islamic Army, its front, and its council, and everyone defend them. Yet on the other hand the Al-Arabiyyah channel fights the Jihadi groups in general and praises the awakenings. Also I will give another example, to prove this contest for power in the cause of satisfying their American masters and fighting the Islamic state using the hired media: In the beginning, the Al-Jazeera channel interviewed the criminal Abu Al-Abid, and at that time, the leadership of the Islamic Army was silent and happy with that interview. But later, when Salman gained him for his confederacy, Abu Al-Abid appeared on Al-Arabiyyah channel (by the instruction of Salman) and disowned the Islamic Army. Therefore the Islamic Army released a statement and disowned him. Also, after Salman induced one leader of the so called Islamic Army, which was ""Abu Azzam At-Tamimi"", and after he was known to be one of the awakenings leaders (i.e. the project of Salman), the Al-Jazeera channel refused to describe him as an ex-leader of the Islamic Army, because this will be considered a disaster to the confederacy of its masters. But when Al-Arabiyyah channel interviewed him, they described him as ""the ex-leader of the Islamic Army"". And that is just for the sake of attacking the confederacy of Qatar-Nayif. Therefore the Islamic Army released a statement with hard wording attacking the Al-Arabiyyah channel. And surely it was not because of the ""scandal"" but to inveigh Salman and his media channels. Maybe some of those who pursue the statements of some ""resistance"" corpses when they call to differentiate between the awakenings , and not judge them all as one entity, as not all of them are considered traitor!! Most of those corpses who have this call participated in constructing the confederacy of Qatar-Nayif in ""the political council of the resistance"". Also those groups who defend these corpses in that council have the same call, although they (i.e. the groups) did not join that council specifically, but they are already in the confederacy of Qatar-Nayif. And they mean by that call the awakenings that they constructed and rule, so they consider them good awakenings, but what Salman rules are bad and traitor, so they call to differentiate between the two. And I leave pursuing the acknowledgments of the ""resistance"" groups' leaders, and their official statements to the brothers who are interested, to refer to them after I exposed this wicked plot of theirs, and they will find many amazing things. And let them be compared with the information I wrote, and the picture will be clarified insha'Allah, about the real situation in Iraq. And then we will see which team is worthy of victory, us or them. So let them plot and betray as much as they can, but know that Allah will surely gain victory to His Religion, and He will support us as long as we support His Religion. And Allah is Our Liege-Lord, while they have no [truthful] liege-lord. [To be continued insha'Allah..]",2009,03,09,2009-03-09 00:00:00.000,2004
13244,31630,11207,Clashes between HAMAS &amp; Jund Ansar Allah kill 24,10,Asadullah Alshishani,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip – Hamas crushed an al-Qaida-inspired group in an hours-long standoff that came to a fiery end when a large explosion killed the radical Muslim group's leader inside his Gaza home on Saturday. The fighting was sparked by a rebellious sermon by the group's leader, and his dramatic death put an end to the greatest internal challenge to Hamas' rule since it took control of Gaza two years ago. In all, the fighting claimed 24 lives — the highest death toll in the territory since the Israel-Hamas war earlier this year. The crackdown targeted Jund Ansar Allah, or the Soldiers of the Companions of God, one of a number of small, shadowy groups that are even more radical than Hamas. The decisive confrontation, in which 95 group members were arrested, solidified Hamas' iron rule in Gaza. The radical groups have sought to expand the Palestinians' battle beyond Israel to include the Western World as well. And in Gaza they have tried to enforce an even stricter version of Islamic law than Hamas and have attacked Internet cafes and wedding parties over behavior they consider improper. The crackdown highlights Hamas' desire to distance itself from militants espousing al-Qaida's ideology and to appear more moderate to the West, though the United States, Israel and others consider Hamas a terrorist organization. The fighting broke out late Friday when Hamas security men surrounded a mosque in the southern Gaza town of Rafah on the Egyptian border where about 100 members of Jund Ansar Allah were holed up. Their leader, Abdel-Latif Moussa, provoked Hamas by declaring Gaza an Islamic emirate during a Friday prayer sermon and daring its leaders to invade his mosque. They did, setting off a fierce gunbattle. Flares lit up the sky and the sound of machine gun fire echoed throughout the night. Moussa escaped with some bodyguards to his home where another standoff ensued. Early Saturday, an explosives vest was detonated as Hamas was trying to convince Moussa to surrender, said Ihab Ghussein, a Hamas Interior Ministry spokesman. ""The so-called Moussa has committed suicide ... killing a mediator who had been sent to him to persuade him and his followers to hand themselves over to the government,"" Ghussein told The Associated Press. Dr. Moaiya Hassanain of the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said 24 people were killed, including six Hamas police officers and an 11-year-old girl. At least 150 people were wounded, he said. Hamas confirmed one of its casualties was a high-ranking commander, Abu Jibril Shimali, whom Israel said orchestrated the capture three years ago of Sgt. Gilad Schalit, an Israeli soldier who is still being held by Hamas. Jund Ansar Allah first came to public attention in June after it claimed responsibility for a failed attempt to attack Israel from Gaza on horseback. The group claims inspiration from al-Qaida's ultraconservative brand of Islam, but no direct links have been confirmed. The group has been critical of Hamas for not imposing a more severe form of Islamic law and for maintaining a cease-fire with Israel for the past seven months. Hamas says it does not impose its religious views on others, but only seeks to set a pious example for people to follow. Hamas also maintains that its struggle is against Israel only, while the radical splinter groups call for a global jihad against the entire Western world. ""They are inspired by unbalanced ideologies and in the past they carried out a number of explosions targeting Internet cafes and wedding parties,"" said Ghussein, adding that the groups do not have any external ties. Israel has charged that terrorists with links to Osama bin Laden have infiltrated Gaza. Hamas has denied this, while trying to distance itself from the more radical groups. ""All of this unacceptable behavior is rejected in our society. We are a Muslim community and we don't need sick-minded people to dictate their agenda on our people,"" said Hamas lawmaker Ismail al-Ashkar. This weekend's violence marked the most serious internal opposition Hamas has faced since it seized control of Gaza and ousted its rivals in the Fatah movement in a five-day civil war in June 2007. The Gaza Strip and the West Bank are together supposed to make up a future Palestinian state, but the rival governments in the two territories — located on opposite sides of Israel — are complicating Palestinian efforts to gain independence. Fatah official Saeb Erekat was quick to comment on the developments, saying ""Gaza is going down the drain in chaos and lawlessness."" Also Saturday, Hamas said it was investigating the launching of 11 homemade rockets from Gaza into Egypt. Only five of the rockets detonated, injuring a young girl, according to Egyptian security forces.",2009,08,15,2009-08-15 00:00:00.000,31383

H1N1 is not the first deadly mutation nor is it the last... Nor is the virus incredibly deadly... It is only deadly due to lack of strength of people who obtain it for some time without being cured of it.. or they have other compounding illness. or even due to the weakening effects of the medicine (Tamiflu) prescribed for it. The only major difference between H1N1 and the regular cold virus is that H1N1 can penetrate much deeper into the lungs while regular does not. The places where the outbreak has been too large is due to the nutrition of the people and the cleanliness of the area as opposed to what would be that controlled outbreak.

(if any muslims here belive in the moon landing conspiracy they need to brush up their science and have a read through http://www.clavius.org/) Similarly on H1N1 virus, most professional Muslims will tell you that this is a natural phenomena and has been occcuring for some time (and that is why there is no cure to common cold). H1N1 is not the first deadly mutation nor is it the last... Nor is the virus incredibly deadly... It is only deadly due to lack of strength of people who obtain it for some time without being cured of it.. or they have other compounding illness. or even due to the weakening effects of the medicine (Tamiflu) prescribed for it. The only major difference between H1N1 and the regular cold virus is that H1N1 can penetrate much deeper into the lungs while regular does not. The places where the outbreak has been too large is due to the nutrition of the people and the cleanliness of the area as opposed to what would be that controlled outbreak. This is from what i remember talking to a muslim pharmacist. I hope I don't have to post again... and inshAllah this brilliant series will carry on I will be travelling at the end of Ramadhan and there are a lot of things I need to prepare for it so I will be absent from online discussions..but inshAllah ramadhan is a great oppertunity for us to make dua for ourselves, the mujahideen and each other. wa salaam. as-Salaam 'Alaykum, What you said about conspiracy theories in general is correct. In regards to H1N1, I don't see any connection between its conspiracy and leaving Jihad. Also, keep in mind, Conspiracy Theories are not wrong to believe in generally speaking (except for things like 9/11, London bombings, USS Cole bombings etc.). For example, many Muslims strongly believe the US Government is controlled by Zionist Jews. Even Shaykh Usama and other leaders of ALQ repeat this. Regarding H1N1, that's just the opinion of the author. If you would like to contribute an article providing evidence that H1N1 is not a conspiracy, you are more than welcome to do so. We are always open to different ideas. Jazakamullahu Khayran",2009,08,16,2009-08-16 00:00:00.000,30985

For example, many Muslims strongly believe the US Government is controlled by Zionist Jews. Even Shaykh Usama and other leaders of ALQ repeat this. What i am advocating is that a muslim should not be paranoid. And proper evidences examined before arriving at a conclusion. For the one who perpetuates myths makes people afraid and mujahid is not afraid. One who perpetuates paranoia make others ""defeatists"" while the mujahid is not among those who are defeated. It is not this specific conspiracy itself but it is the mentality of those who tend to believe in conspiracy theories. I am not critcising the article for sake of it but i feel such mentality exist in many who seek to find excuses from hijrah and jihad (or even supporting it with their mouth). There is certainly good analysis done on the virus itself but there must also be cohesion in evidences in general and you cannot always take the single odd evidence and hope it is the truth. I hope the author would speak to many more professionals and answer more questions then this first article in this series poses. And I would not be a good muslim if I didn't give naseehah as two weeks before I did have a lengthy conversation on this very topic with a muslim pharmacist myself but I am not the one to memorise his evidence and present them to you and I apologise for that. (and conincendently the reason why the topic came up is because someone who did believe in similar theory questioned him on it while I was present in their company). As for the invitation to contribute, akhi I would love to but as I mentioned there are various projects I need to complete and other circumstantial evidences I am busy with and I would not liked to have even given naseehah on this minor issue except that I remembered what happens in dawah when people claim x y and z and refuse to budge from their position due to weak evidences. Again I apologise because of my lack of discipline and ask for dua on my behalf.",2009,08,16,2009-08-16 00:00:00.000,30985

Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi akhi Allah subhana wa ta'ala says in Sura al-Baqara, Aya 191 (translation of the meaning): Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for Allah loveth not transgressors. Whatever you could possibly do to them is nothing in comparison what waits for them after their death. So what's the use in torturing them or killing them in a very painful way? We should better stay away from such extreme things, as the moderate way is the correct way. And the judgement is only to Allah ta'ala Wa alaikum assalam",2009,08,24,2009-08-24 00:00:00.000,33314

Do you know what the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa salama said he would do to the khawaarij...............? The khawaarij were not murtadeen like these shayateen, but rather they were classed as Muslim mubtadi'een [deviants], even though a few later groups did apostate, the majority of the khawaarij were classed as Muslims. The Messenger of Allah sallallahu alayhi wa salama said about these deviant Muslims, that if they were to appear whilst he was alive, he would slaughter/punish them like the people of 'Aad and Thamood...........! Also the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa salama considered burning alive in their homes, the people who did not pray jama'ah in the Masjid, [and it was only due to the harm which would be caused to the innocent family of these people that prevented him].......! Also 'Umar ibn al-Khattaab radi Allahu 'anhu said that the sodomites should be thrown off the top of the highest mountain. The Sahaabah and the rightly guided rulers from the taabi'een used to cut off the opposite limbs of the ""highwayman"" [bughaat]. I would like those who condemn to produce some statements of the Imaams of the Salaf us Saaliheen who have said it is not allowed for Ahl ul-haali wa al-'aqd to decide upon the modality of the punishments for such crimes..? We must not base our opinions upon personal opinions such as I have read in this thread, but rather, before ANYONE puts forth their opinion, they should have first asked, what is the Islamic ruling regarding such and such a matter, as this is what matters and carries weight, not our opinions. Baaraka Allahu feekum. Are any of us qualified to make istidlaal of the texts...? One of the brothers mentioned an ayah from al-Baqarah, but perhaps he forgot the ayah which is MORE relevent, فَمَنِ اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ فَاعْتَدُواْ عَلَيْهِ بِمِثْلِ مَا اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ And Allah says in the same soorah in translation, ""So whomever transgresses against you, then you may transgress against them in the same way.""

Do you know the ""counterfeit salafis"" try to hide that ""their"" shaykh al-'uthaymeen said about this ayah that if they kill our women and children, then we are permitted to kill their women and children even though it means loosing some ghaneemah...? I advise myself and all my beloved and noble brothers and sisters NOT to be so quick to praise and condemn, nor to put forward opinions, but rather seek knowledge, and then benefit us all with this knowledge on the forum insha'Allah.

So do the kuffaar not bomb and explode and blow up our beloved sisters, mothers and our babies into tiny pieces...........? So please let me clarify, that my post was not in reference to the punishment of the spies in the video, but to what brother insurgent posted. I did not comment in regard to the video because i lack the knowdledge to say if it is right or wrong, my comment was just directed to what i quoted. As for the punishment of spies, the capital punishment is clearly an option, and i never denied that. Quote: 5 – Spies. The spy is the one who spies on the Muslims and transmits information to their enemies. The evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (3007) and Muslim (2494) which says that Haatib ibn Abi Balta’ah wrote to some of the mushrikeen in Makkah telling them some information about the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O Haatib, what is this?” He said, “O Messenger of Allaah, do not hasten to judge me. I was a man closely connected to Quraysh, but I did not belong to this tribe, while the other Muhaajireen with you had their relatives in Makkah who would protect their families and property. So I wanted to make up for my lack of blood ties to them by doing them a favor so that they might protect my family. I did not do this because of disbelief or apostasy nor out of preferring kufr (disbelief) to Islam.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “He has told you the truth.” ‘Umar said, “O Messenger of Allaah! Let me chop off the head of this hypocrite!” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “He was present at the battle of Badr, and you do not know, perhaps Allaah looked at the people of Badr and said, ‘Do whatever you like, for I have forgiven you.’” The point in this hadeeth is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) agreed with ‘Umar that Haatib deserved to be executed for this action, but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him that there was a reason why he should not be killed, which is that he was one of those who was present at the battle of Badr. Ibn al-Qayyim said in Zaad al-Ma’aad (2/115) concerning the hadeeth of Haatib ibn Abi Balta’ah: This was quoted as evidence by those who do not think that the Muslim spy should be killed, such as al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad and Abu Haneefah (may Allaah have mercy on them). And it was quoted as evidence by those who think that the spy should be killed, such as Maalik and Ibn ‘Aqeel among the companions of Ahmad, and others. They said: This is because the reason for not killing him was that he had been present at Badr. If being Muslim was the reason for not killing him, he would not have given a reason that is more specific, which is the fact that he had been present at Badr. And he said elsewhere in Zaad al-Ma’aad (3/422): The correct view is that execution of a spy depends on the opinion of the ruler; if executing him is in the Muslims’ interests, he should be executed, but if letting him live serves a greater interest, then he should be allowed to live. And Allaah knows best. The above also includes the one who does not pray, the one who practices witchcraft, and the heretic, because they come under the heading of “the one who leaves his religion and splits from the jamaa’ah.” With regard to the conditions of implementing this punishment, there are many. Each crime has its own specific conditions, details of which may be found in the books of fiqh.

May he unify us and prevent any fitna between us and may he reward you for your beneficial contributions. Wa alaikum assalam As-Salamu 'Alaykum Wa-Rahmat Allah It was said in his class on Bulugh al-Maram, and was translated by Tibyan here: Quote: The Verdict of Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Sālih Al-‘Uthaymīn The Shaykh, may Allāh be merciful towards him, said in a tape recording regarding this topic : “And the second (matter) is the forbiddance of killing women and children in times of war. But if it is said: ‘If they (the kuffār) do this to us- meaning that they kill our children and women- Then do we then kill them?’ The apparent [Thāhir] is that it is (permissible) for us to kill their women and children- even if it means that we lose profit/benefit from it [since keeping them alive is a profit/benefit because they become the property of the Muslims]; (and killing them in this situation is permissible) due to it threatening the hearts of the enemies and a humiliation for them. And due to the generality of the Statement of Allāh: فَمَنِ اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ فَاعْتَدُواْ عَلَيْهِ بِمِثْلِ مَا اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ “Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress likewise against him” [Al-Baqarah: 194] And to (purposely) destroy property (which could later belong) for the Muslims (by killing them in this case) is nothing strange. And due to this, the baggage, the baggage of the one who steals from the Ghanīmah is burned, even though in that, there is the loss of some property of one the fighters. Then if someone says: ‘If they rape our women then do we rape their women?’ No, this, no, no we do not do it. Why? Because this is prohibited as a (whole) category [i.e. it is forbidden within itself], and it is not possible for us to do it. Meaning, it is not forbidden out of respect for the rights of others [i.e. not because we are respecting their rights] - rather, because it is forbidden as a category [i.e. the action of ‘intercourse’]. So it is not permissible for us to rape their women. But if the dividing (of the Ghanīmah) takes place, and the woman from them ends up as a slave woman, then she becomes property of the right hand. The person can have intercourse with her as a right hand possession, which is permissible and there is nothing wrong with this” Later on, the Shaykh was asked about the fact that the women being killed are not the ones who killed our women, so is this justice? So he answered: فَمَنِ اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ فَاعْتَدُواْ عَلَيْهِ بِمِثْلِ مَا اعْتَدَى عَلَيْكُمْ “ Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress likewise against him” [Al-Baqarah: 194] What is justice? Not at all. They kill our women, we kill their women. This is the justice. It’s not justice to say ‘if they kill our women we won’t kill your women.’ Because this, I notice from this that it has many enormous affects on them” End of quote from Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Sālih Al-‘Uthaymīn, may Allāh have mercy upon him.

The Ministry of Defense said Monday that the two soldiers, from the Black Watch, Third Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, were killed while on foot patrol north of Lashkar Gah District in Helmand Province. The news comes a few hours after two more US soldiers were killed in the war-torn country. The latest deaths came as the top US commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal called for a change in strategy if any success was to be realized for the operation in Afghanistan. Britain has about 9,000 troops in Afghanistan, with most of them deployed in Helmand. Two US soldiers have been killed in separate bomb attacks in Afghanistan, bringing to 179 the US death toll in the country this year. On the same day the top US commander in Afghanistan presented a report on a failed US strategy in the country, the American military reported two more losses in the region. The soldiers from the NATO-led International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) were killed in road-side bomb explosions in southern Afghanistan, the military said in a statement. The latest fatality brought to 809 the number of American soldiers killed in Afghanistan since the start of the US-led war to overthrow the Taliban regime in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001. Earlier in the day, General Stanley McChrystal reported that the 8-year-old war in Afghanistan can still be won but only with a revised strategy. As he announced the conclusion of a long-awaited review of strategy in the country, speculations were raised that could seek more troops. Rising insurgency had prompted the administration of US President Barack Obama to send another 4,000 troops to Afghanistan, in addition to 17,000 extra troops already deployed in the war-ravaged country. There are around 100,000 US and NATO-led troops in Afghanistan. A roadside bomb explosion has killed a British soldier in the troubled southern Afghanistan, bringing to 211 the overall British fatalities in the war-ravaged country. The British Ministry of Defense said Thursday that the soldier was killed after his vehicle was struck by an explosion in southern Helmand province. A Spokesman for the British Task Force in Helmand confirmed the incident, saying the armed forces were ""deeply saddened by the death of this brave soldier."" The insurgency has intensified in the eastern and southern provinces where the foreign troops have lost several grounds to the Taliban-linked militants over the past months. There are currently more than 100,000 international soldiers in Afghanistan. The US-led force lost 77 more troops there during August, setting a new monthly casualty record since the occupation began in 2001.

Dr Crispus Kiyonga told Journalists after flagging-off three UPDF battalions to Somalia at Entebbe military airbase yesterday that the earlier mandate constrained the UPDF and was deadly as it demanded the peacekeepers to fight back only if they were attacked first.

""Our view as Uganda and Burundi has been that the mandate under which we are operating was very constraining,"" Mr Kiyonga said.

Currently, the army just seats where they are in their detachments even when they have information that insurgents are just two kilometres away,"" he said, ""They [UPDF] can not attack them.

17031,37999,13050,As-Sahab: An address to the American people by the Lion of Islam Sheikh Usama bin Laden (May Allah Protect Him),1778,محمد عمر,"Source NYT [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/14/wo...r=1&ref=world] September 14, 2009 Bin Laden Addresses Americans in Tape By MARK McDONALD Two days after the eighth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, Osama bin Laden apparently released a new audiotape, entitled “An Address to the American People,” news agencies reported Monday. The tape appeared on As-Sahab, the Arabic-language Web site used by Al Qaeda to deliver its messages. The recording was reported and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group and IntelCenter, two groups in the United States that monitor jihadist Web sites. SITE said the message, which was released on Sept. 13 and lasted 11 minutes, 20 seconds, offered reasons for Al Qaeda’s attacks in New York and Washington on Sept. 11, 2001, and advised how the conflict between Al Qaeda and the United States might come to a close. The group said the recording spoke of injustices against the Muslim world, mentioning American support for Israel. IntelCenter said the message consisted of a still image of Bin Laden with a voice track underneath, news agencies reported. An employee of IntelCenter could not immediately be reached for comment about its translation of the tape, and it was not possible to verify that the recording was actually made by Mr. Bin Laden. The last tape attributed to Mr. Bin Laden, the Qaeda leader who is widely thought to be hiding in the mountainous region along the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan, was issued June 3. That message, which came as President Obama was embarking on a tour of Muslim countries, warned the United States about its policies in Pakistan. It said the new American administration had sowed new seeds of hatred among Muslims. “I think the reports we’ve seen are consistent with messages we’ve seen in the past from Al Qaeda threatening the U.S. and other countries that are involved in counterterrorism efforts,” the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said at the time. “But I don’t think it’s surprising that Al Qaeda would want to shift attention away from the president’s historic efforts and continued efforts to reach out and have an open dialogue with the Muslim world.” _____________________________________________ Source SITE [https://www.siteintelgroup.com/Pages/Default.aspx] Bin Laden Addresses Americans on Eighth Anniversary of 9/11 9/13/2009 | Americas Usama bin Laden, the head of al-Qaeda, addressed the American people on the eighth anniversary of 9/11 in an 11 minute, 20 second audio message produced by as-Sahab and released on jihadist forums on September 13, 2009. His speech, titled, “Message to the American People,” explains in the part the cause of al-Qaeda’s attacks in New York and Washington on September 11, 2001, and advises how the conflict between al-Qaeda and the US may come to a close. Bin Laden says that amongst “some other injustices,” US support to Israel motivated al-Qaeda to launch the 9/11 attacks. He also explains that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are pushed by the pro-Israel lobby. [...] _____________________________________________ Source Le Monde (french upper class newspaper) Translation محمد عمر New audio message attributed to Bin Laden LEMONDE.FR with AFP and Reuters | 14.09.09 | 07h06 • Updated 14.09.09 | 08h08 The website As-Sahab, frequently used by Al Qaeda to transmit its messages, issued on Monday, September 14, a video attributed to Osama bin Laden. In this recording, entitled ""A statement to the American people"", lasting about ten minutes, the Islamic leader warned the American people against all ties with Israel, says the American research center on terrorism Intel Center. He called the president to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, otherwise ""we will pursue a war of attrition against you in every way possible,"" bin Laden threats, in what the site offers as a ""message to American people. "" Osama Bin Laden says it is the support of the United States to Israel that led Al Qaeda to launch the attacks of September 11, 2001. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were triggered by the pro-Israel lobby in the White House and the defenders of corporate interests, not Islamic militants, he says. According to Osama bin Laden, President Barack Obama has no power to change the course of wars, and the fact that he retained the Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and other officials of the previous administration of George W. Bush confirms his weakness. A few days ago, As-Sahab announced a broadcast during Ramadan a ""gift"" to Muslims on the part of bin Laden, who is hiding in mountainous and the remote border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. This message was broadcast a few days after the eighth anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001, attributed to militants from Al Qaeda and which caused nearly 3 000 people dead. In the previous paper of the head of Al-Qaida released in June, Osama bin Laden accused the United States have sowed ""seeds of hatred"" among Muslims. Since the attacks of September 11, attributed to Al Qaeda, about sixty messages were broadcast by bin Laden and his deputy, Egyptian Ayman Al-Zawahiri. The hunt for bin Laden, launched after the attacks with the invasion of Afghanistan, could still take many years and may never arrive, had estimated in March the Secretary of Defense Robert Gates.",2009,09,14,2009-09-14 00:00:00.000,37886

The troops, who according to some reports had uniforms with French insignia, attacked a vehicle carrying Islamists from the al-Shabab group. Witnesses said the troops took away some men, and there were two bodies left in the road after the attack, in the southern coastal town of Barawe. A French military spokesman has denied its forces were involved. ""There was no French operation,"" said admiral Christophe Prazuck, spokesman for the armed forces' general staff, according to the AFP news agency. He said the only French forces in the region were tackling pirates off the coast and did not intervene on land. A village elder said four foreign helicopters took part in the raid. ""A car was destroyed, we are also hearing that some of the vehicle's passengers were taken on the helicopters,"" he told AFP. French commandos have launched raids in the past to rescue their citizens from pirates or militants. There is a French military base in neighbouring Djibouti. The assault comes several weeks after a Frenchman held by militants in Mogadishu managed to get free. Somalia has not had a functioning central government since 1991. Rival Islamist factions are battling forces loyal to the weak UN-backed government, which only controls small parts of the capital Mogadishu.",2009,09,14,2009-09-14 00:00:00.000,38034

A senior al Qaeda operative behind the 1998 attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania is believed to have been killed during a raid by covert forces in southern Somalia. Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan and another person are thought to have been killed in the southern town of Barawe during a raid by what was originally reported to be French commandos; the raid is now said to have been carried out by US Special Forces. Witnesses said foreign troops swept into the town on helicopters, fired missiles from an attack helicopter, killed Nabhan and another terrorist, and captured two others after wounding them, Mareeg reported. Nabhan's body was recovered, ABC News later reported. Another report indicated that four Shabaab and al Qaeda fighters were killed during the raid. Sheikh Hussein Ali Fidow, a senior Shabaab leader, is said to have been one of those killed along with Nabhan. In the past, the US has launched several air and naval strikes against al Qaeda and Shabaab leaders in Somalia, including a March 4, 2008 strike that targeted Nabhan in Dhobley. Sheikh Aden Hashi Ayro, the military commander of Shabaab, was killed during a US strike in May 2008. Nabhan is a senior leader in Al Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked group in Somalia that controls vast swaths of territory in the South and in the capital of Mogadishu. He has been instrumental in brokering Shabaab's merger with al Qaeda. Nabhan has been one of the most sought out al Qaeda operatives in Africa. He is wanted for involvement in the 1998 suicide attacks against US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The attack in Nairobi, Kenya resulted in 212 killed and more than 4,000 wounded. The attack in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania resulted in 11 killed and 85 wounded. Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, al Qaeda's operations chief in East Africa; and Abu Taha al Sudani, the leader of al Qaeda's network in East Africa, were also behind the attacks. Sudani was killed during the fighting to oust the Islamic Courts in early 2007. Nabhan is also wanted by the FBI for questioning in connection with the 2002 attacks in Mombasa, Kenya against a hotel and an airliner. In near-simultaneous attacks, Nabhan targeted a hotel frequented by Israelis and an Israeli-chartered airplane. Suicide bombers rammed a truck into the lobby of hotel visited by Israelis; 13 were killed and 80 wounded. At the same time as the hotel attack, al Qaeda launched two Strela surface-to-air missiles at an Arkia Airlines jet. The missiles missed their targets.

17141,38181,13088,Breaking News: The cursed American army bombed Somalia,172,RebelzGang,"Unknown helicopters target a vehicle in south Somalia MOGADISHU, Sept. 14- Six unidentified helicopters have fired missiles and used heavy machineguns in an attack against a vehicle in the southern Somali town of Barawe, killing some of its occupants and seizing the wounded, residents said on Monday. It was not clear what the identity of the helicopters or occupants of the targeted vehicle were. The area where the attack took place is under the control of the Islamist Al Shabaab movement whose one of the main leaders was killed by U.S. missile attack in central Somalia town of Guriel. Neither the Somali government nor the rebel group so far commented on the attack. The development came after Somalis held mass funeral on Saturday for nine disabled war veterans who died Friday night after a mortar shell fired by Islamist insurgents opposed to the Somali government slammed their homes in Mogadishu. The former soldiers, most of who disabled in the 1977 war with neighboring Ethiopia, lived with their families in a dilapidated and disused hospital in Mogadishu where they are dependent on the support of local residents in Mogadishu and Somalis in the Diaspora. The veterans are well respected by Somalis and the funeral was attended by senior Somali security officials and security was tightened along the route to the cemetery by African Union peacekeeping forces. Although no group had claimed responsibility for the attack, the Somali government official had accused the Islamist Al Shabaab for the death and injury of the veterans and their families. Al-Shabaab which controls much of southern and central Somalia is fighting the Somali government forces and African Union peacekeeping troops. Also at the weekend, at least three people were killed and nine others wounded on Saturday Somaliland, northwest Somalia, following clashes between protests and local police, officials and residents said. Angry demonstrators clashed with riot police who prevented them from entering into the parliament building which the authorities in Somaliland said was closed down to avoid a repeat of the last week's scuffles between the opposition and pro-government lawmakers.",2009,09,14,2009-09-14 00:00:00.000,38034
17169,38218,13088,Breaking News: The cursed American army bombed Somalia,10,Asadullah Alshishani,"MOGADISHU, Somalia – Foreign troops in helicopters strafed a car Monday in a Somali town controlled by Islamist insurgents, killing two men and capturing two others who were wounded, witnesses said. U.S. military officials said American forces were involved in the raid. The commando-style action took place in a village near Barawe amid growing fears that al-Qaida is gaining a foothold in this lawless nation. Two U.S. military officials said forces from the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command were involved. The officials gave no details about the raid or its target, and they spoke on condition of anonymity because the operation was secret. Many experts fear Somalia is becoming a haven for al-Qaida, a place for terrorists to train and gather strength — much like Afghanistan in the 1990s. The U.N.-backed government, with support from African Union peacekeepers, holds only a few blocks of Mogadishu, the war-ravaged capital. Last year, U.S. missiles killed reputed al-Qaida commander Aden Hashi Ayro — the first major success after a string of U.S. military attacks in 2008. Like much of Somalia, Barawe and its surrounding villages are controlled by the militant group al-Shabab, which the U.S. accuses of having ties to al-Qaida. Al-Shabab, which has foreign fighters in its ranks, seeks to overthrow the government and impose a strict form of Islam in Somalia. Witness Abdi Ahmed said six helicopters buzzed the village before two of the aircraft opened fire. After the helicopters fired, soldiers in military fatigues got out and left with the two wounded men. ""There was only a burning vehicle and two dead bodies lying beside it,"" said Mohamed Ali Aden, a bus driver who drove past the burnt-out car minutes after the attack, some 155 miles (250 kilometers) south of Mogadishu. Somalia's weak government has very few resources and does not have helicopters or other modern equipment. Witness Dahir Ahmed said the helicopters took off from a warship flying a French flag, but that could not be confirmed and French military spokesman Christophe Prazuck denied the attack was a French operation. ""They are not French helicopters,"" he said. France previously has launched commando raids to rescue French nationals. The U.S. government — haunted by the deadly 1993 U.S. military assault in Mogadishu chronicled in the 1999 book ""Black Hawk Down,"" made into a 2001 film — is trying to neutralize the growing terrorist threat without sending in troops. Somalia has been ravaged by violence and anarchy since warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991 and then turned on each other. A moderate Islamist was elected president in January in hopes that he could unite the country's feuding factions, but the violence has continued unabated. Mogadishu sees near-daily battles between government and insurgent forces. Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed. Somalia's lawlessness also has allowed piracy to flourish off its coast, making the Gulf of Aden one of the most dangerous waterways in the world.",2009,09,15,2009-09-15 00:00:00.000,38034

Kenyan-born Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, 28, was suspected of building the truck bomb that killed 15 people at a Kenyan hotel in 2002, as well as involvement on a botched missile launch at an Israeli airliner. A senior Somali government source said Nabhan was in a car with other foreign insurgents from the al Shabaab rebel group when they were hit near Roobow village in Barawe District, around 150 miles south of the capital Mogadishu. Washington says al Shabaab represents al Qaeda in Somalia. A Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman declined to comment ""on any alleged operation in Somalia"". But it is understood that special forces aboard two helicopters that flew from a US Navy ship opened fired on the vehicle that they believed contained Nabhan. A total of four Somalis were killed while a Somali government source said Nabhan and four others died. Western security agencies say Somalia has become a safe haven for militants, including foreign jihadists, who use it to plot attacks in the region and beyond. Nabhan, who has long been on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Most Wanted list, is believed to have fled to Somalia after the 2002 bombing of a Israeli-owned Kenyan beach hotel. He is believed to have owned the vehicle used in the attack on the hotel near Mombasa in 2002 that killed 15 people. He is also wanted by the FBI in connection with the missile attack on an Israeli airliner in Mombasa the same year. Some reports in US media say Nabhan was involved in the bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in which more than 250 died.",2009,09,15,2009-09-15 00:00:00.000,38034

17689,38920,13341,"Al-Fajr: ""Security ... a shared destiny""  By Al Hafidh Abu Talha The German",10,Asadullah Alshishani,"بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم مركز الفجر للإعلام يقدم [ الأمن ... (قاسم مشترك) ] [ Sicherheit...ein geteiltes Schicksal ] للأخ / الحافظ أبي طلحة الألماني حفظه الله von Al Hafidh Abu Talha der Deutsche قال تعالى:﴿ قُل لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ إِن يَنتَهُواْ يُغَفَرْ لَهُم مَّا قَدْ سَلَفَ وَإِنْ يَعُودُواْ فَقَدْ مَضَتْ سُنَّةُ الأَوَّلِينِ﴾ (الأنفال: 38) الحمد لله معز الإسلام بنصره ومذل الشرك بقهره ومصرف الأمور بأمره ومستدرج الكافرين بمكره، الذي قدر الأيام دولاً بعدله والصلاة والسلام على من أعلى الله منار الإسلام بسيفه. أشكر ألمانيا على مساعدتها السريعة لإخراجي من السجن في سوريا. أشكر ألمانيا على مساعدتها لي عند إصابتي في مدينة الخليل في فلسطين. أشكر ألمانيا على أنها لم تؤذي أهلي بعد سفري إلى أفغانستان ولم تمنعها من السفر رغم المراقبة الطويلة. وبما أن جزاء الإحسان في الإسلام هو الإحسان، فإنني سأبدي اليوم اعترافي بالجميل. عموماً يراعى أن ألمانيا ليست ملطخة بالدماء مثل الدول المستعمرة وكذلك يراعى أن أغلبية الشعب الألماني يريدون سحب جنودهم المحتلين من أفغانستان ولا ينبغي أبدًا أن ننسى رفض الألمان الصريح المشاركة في حرب العراق. لهذه الأسباب فإن القاعدة تمنح الفرصة للشعب الألماني لتجنب القادم في ألمانيا. ولكن القاعدة ستسير على نفس الطريق الدبلوماسي الذي يراه شتاين مير (وزير الخارجية) لازما لحل الصراع النووي مع إيران بطريقة سلمية، حيث أكد وزير الخارجية الألماني: ""بدون خيار عسكري لا نستطيع أن نمارس بالدبلوماسية الضغط اللازم"". إن نوع هذا الحوار هو الذي يعلمنا إياه القرآن. الله تبارك وتعالى يقص علينا في القران أنه أمر موسى عليه السلام أن يحاور فرعون باللين لأنه طغى. هدف هذا الحوار لم يكن من أجل الاستسلام لعدو جبار، بل كان الهدف كما يخبرنا الله تعالى: ﴿ لَّعَلَّهُ يَتَذَكَّرُ أَوْ يَخْشَى﴾ (طه : 44 ) ، موسى عليه السلام الذي تربى في بيت فرعون كان يريد أن يصرف عن فرعون هلاكا قادما ولكن فرعون لم يستجب. وبما أن الليونة لابد لها من حد إذا كان الحوار بدون نتيجة، فإن موسى عليه السلام قال لفرعون مهددا:﴿وَإِنِّي لَأَظُنُّكَ يَا فِرْعَونُ مَثْبُوراً[1]﴾ (الإسراء : 102 ). قبل أن أدخل في التفاصيل دعوني أوضح أولاً مَن الذي يلام على المشاركة الألمانية في الحرب على أفغانستان. الخريف 2001: مع حلول الاحتفال بالذكرى 18 للدخول الأول إلى البرلمان الألماني، ظن حزب الخضر أنهم ببلوغهم ""سن الرشد"" ناضجون بما فيه الكفاية لخوض أكبر مشاركة عسكرية ألمانية خارج أوروبا بعد الحرب العالمية الثانية. إن حماة البيئة ودعاة السلام الرافضين لكل حرب كوسيلة للمواجهة كان بوسعهم أن يجنبوا الشعب الأفغاني مشاركة ألمانية في الحرب وبهذا يجنبون الشعب الألماني الضرر الناتج عن المشاركة. لكن يبدو أن حلاوة الجلوس على مقاعد الفائزين لأول مرة في البرلمان الألماني كان يستحق التخلي عن المبادئ التي يعظمونها وفتح أبواب الشر على ألمانيا. وبسؤال الثقة قام شرودر بدفن مبادئ الخضر نهائيا وأنهى عهد الأمن الألماني الجديد الذي بدأ في عام 1982. اسمحوا لي أن أصف ائتلاف الحمر مع الخضر آنذاك ب ""الائتلاف المغربي"". رأيي أن هذا الوصف لا يوضح نسبة الحمر والخضر في الائتلاف فحسب، ولكنه يوضح كذلك دور الحليف الصغير (الخضر) في الحكومة آنذاك. إن العلم المغربي معظمه أحمر إلا أن الأخضر القليل يقع في الوسط ويميزه ويعطي له تعريفا. إن الخضر هم الذين لعبوا في مسائل سياسية أساسية دورا رئيسيا وقالوا لعدوان شرودر: ""نحن نفتح الطريق"" (كما يقول المثل الألماني). (وينطبق على الخضر كذلك المثل الألماني ""حتى البهائم الصغيرة تروث"" والخضر قد أخطئوا كثيرا جدا. ولكن من المسئول الرئيسي عن المشاركة الألمانية في الحرب على أفغانستان. إذا نظرنا إلى المسألة بتمعن فإنه ينبغي علينا أن نوضح بحزم أن هناك حقائق تحمّل طرفاً آخر مسؤولية أكبر. منها / أولا: في النظام الديمقراطي الساسة ممثلو الشعب فقط. ثانيا: في نظام السيادة للشعب يقرر البرلمان للشعب ولا يحكم عليه. ثالثا: في النظام الديمقراطي يكون مصدر كل سلطة الشعب، وكذلك ""العنف"" ضد المدنين الأفغان.[السلطة والعنف في اللغة الألمانية يعبّر عنها بلفظ واحدٍ]. رابعا: في نظام السيادة للشعب يحمّل الشعب كدافع للضرائب مسئولية جرائم الطائرات من طراز ""تورنادو"". خامسا: في النظام الديمقراطي يعتبر التصويت لحزب أو شخص تأييدا لاعتقاده ورأيه وموقفه. التصويت هو تفويض لحزب أو شخص لفترة محددة لينوب عن المفوض في مؤسسة برلمانية. سادسا: في نظام السيادة للشعب تعني إعادة انتخاب الحكومة لولاية أخرى تبرئة لها من أعمالها العدوانية. وبناءا على هذا فإنه يلزم في النظام الديموقراطي معاقبة الحاكم - الشعب - على العدوان أولا. أما فيما يتعلق بالأقلية فإن النظام الديموقراطي يفرض عليها أن تقبل القوانين المشرَّعة من قِبَل الأغلبية كما عليها أن تعاني من نتائجها. فماذا ينتظر الشعب الألماني إذن؟ الجواب على هذا السؤال متعلق بنتائج الانتخابات كما أُعْلِن عن ذلك في خطة الإنقاذ. إذا حللنا سياسة ستين عاما لجمهورية ألمانيا الحديثة، فإنه يمكننا أن نتوقع الفائز في الانتخابات. منذ آدِنَوَر (أول مستشار ألماني بعد الحرب العالمية الثانية) استطاع المستشارون المحافظون أن يحكموا في المعدل ثمان سنوات. أما المستشارون الاشتراكيون الديموقراطيون فقد استطاعوا أن يبقوا في منصبهم تقريبا سبع سنوات في المعدل. وبما أن شرودر استطاع أن يحقق هذا المعدل فإنه من المتوقع أن تحقق أنجيلا ميركل معدل المستشار المحافظ في الحكم. هذا التوقع تدعمه كذلك الحقيقة بأن الحزب الاشتراكي الديموقراطي في كلا حالتي تسليم السلطة للمحافظين، لم يتم نزع كرسي الزعامة منه إلا بسبب سحب الثقة. بعد شْمِدِت (ثاني مستشار اشتراكي ديموقراطي) لم يستطع الحزب الاشتراكي الديموقراطي أن يسترجع الثقة إلا ببطء وعناء. يبدو أنه وفق انتخابات البرلمان الأوروبي وحسب استطلاعات الرأي فإن التاريخ سيعيد نفسه. وإذا تحقق هذا التوقع فإن الألمان تنتظرهم أوقاتٌ مرة. وأحب أن أذكر الألمان بموقف ميركل تجاه حرب العراق. إن ميركل كرئيسة لحزب المحافظين ورئيسة لكتلة المحافظين في البرلمان آنذاك أرادت -لإصرارها على حرب غير مؤيدة شعبيا- تحمل الهزيمة في الانتخابات وقبول تهديد آخر وغير ضروري للأمن الداخلي. إن أغلبية الشعب الألماني كان رافضا للحرب رفضا قطعيا، ورغم ذلك فإن ميركل بقيت وفية لسياسة المحافظين العدوانية ضد العراق المهيمنة في أوروبا، ووضحت للشعب أن الديموقراطية ليست إلا التصويت على البرامج السياسية التي يضعها الآخرون. وكذلك بعد اندلاع حرب العراق بقيت ميركل مصرة على موقفها من هذه الحرب المخالفة للقانون الدولي وأعلنت في أول تصريح لها (بعد اندلاع الحرب) استعدادها لتحمل المسؤولية. يا سيدة ميركل: ما هي النتيجة المنطقية التي جناها المحافظون البريطانيون والأسبان من تأييدهم لحرب العراق؟ لماذا تشارك ألمانيا في الحرب على أفغانستان؟ إن الشعب الأفغاني لم يفعل شيئا للشعب الألماني، والمجاهدون لم يفعلوا شيئا للشعب الألماني. لو كانت القاعدة تريد استهداف ألمانيا بدون سبب لوفر محمد عطا (رحمه الله) على نفسه جهدا كبيرا ونفذ عمليتَهُ في ألمانيا مباشرة. إن الحكومة الألمانية تخدع شعبها بكثرة، إنها تستخدم أعذاراً هي في الحقيقة مجرد وسيلة لتبرئة عدوانها. هل يمكن لمن أراد أن يدافع عن أمنه أن يجعل - كثالث أكبر قوة- إعادةَ الأعمار وحده قضيته الرئيسية؟ هل يمكن لمن أراد أن يدافع عن أمنه أن يحصر العمل العسكري – هذا إذا شاركوا - فقط في شمال أفغانستان؟ هل يمكن لمن أراد أن يدافع عن أمنه أن يتجنب عمدا جنوب أفغانستان؟ هل تدافع الحكومة الألمانية في أفغانستان حقا عن أمن موطنيها ومواطناتها؟ دجل محض يا سيدة ميركل! الأمن الألماني لم يكن مهدداً قط قبل انتهاك السيادة الأفغانية من طرف الجيش الألماني - الذي هو في الأصل جيش دفاعي فقط. إن القاعدة ما كان لها وليس لها مصلحة في الدخول في صراع مع ألمانيا. بالإضافة إلى ذلك أظن أنه يوجد 12 سببا توضّحُ أن أي عدوان ألماني قرار طائش للغاية. دعوني أذكر أربعة منها : أولا: إن اقتصاد ألمانيا وقطاع الوظائف مبني على التصدير. إن فقدان الألمان لسمعتهم سوف يؤثر على اقتصادها تأثيرا سلبيا، وقد تكون النتيجة ازدياد تراجع النمو الاقتصادي وبطالة ضخمة. إن ضخامة الديون المتراكمة على ألمانيا بمقدار 1.6 تريليون وضُعف الدخل وزيادة المصاريف القادمة وحدها تجعل الألمان يعيدون النظر في سياستهم الخارجة من أجل مصلحتهم. كذلك تنصح شركات العائلات المالكة - الذين هم عمود الاقتصاد الألماني - نصيحة مفيدة بأن يتخذوا موقفا معارضا من عدوان ممثليهم على أفغانستان. إن الأزمة الاقتصادية التي تمخضت عن 11.09 قد غيرت العالم. ثانيا: الأوروبيون ليس لهم على عكس الأمريكان محيط أطلسي يجعل تسلل المجاهدين عبر البر أمرا مستحيلا ويحفظهم من مواجهة مباشرة مع المجاهدين. ثالثا: ألمانيا لها مشكلة أمنية كبيرة. لقد تغافل الأمن الألماني عن اللبنانيين الذين أرادا تفجير القطارين. وأما خلية زورلاند فلم يكشفها الأمن الألماني إلى بعد تنبيه من الأمريكان. إن الأمريكان لا يستطيعون دوما أن ينقذوا الألمان، وأما الأمن الألماني فلا طاقة له بحماية الألمان أصلا. رابعا: إن الحكومة الألمانية لا تأخذ تهديدات القاعدة على محمل الجد ولا تسمع لما يقوله المجاهدون لتجنب تطور غير مرغوب فيه. لماذا يا ترى؟ يقول الله العليم: ﴿ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا لَا يَرْجُونَ حِسَاباً ۞ وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا كِذَّاباً ۞ وَكُلَّ شَيْءٍ أَحْصَيْنَاهُ كِتَاباً ۞ فَذُوقُوا فَلَن نَّزِيدَكُمْ إِلَّا عَذَاباً ﴾ (النبأ :27-28-29- 30 ). ألم يعتبر ممثلو الشعب الألماني من لندن ولا من مومباي؟ أفأمنوامن الحساب حتى لو لم يأخذ القصاص مجراه إلا بعد عقد من الزمن؟ أما إزالة الشريعة في أفغانستان فقد كلفت الشعب الألماني ثمنا باهظا ؛ المبادئ الأساسية التي ضحى الشعب من أجلها كثيراً لم تعد موجودة إلا في كتب التعليم. ألا يشعر المنتخبون من الشعب بأي ذنب؟ أما الذنب فعند ممثلي الشعب الألماني منه أكثر من الشعر على رؤوسهم. هل يمكن لدولة غزوُ دولةٍ ذات سيادة والإطاحة بحكومتها والسعي حثيثا لإزالة دستورها - القران الكريم – وتعتقد مع ذلك عدم تعرض سيادتها وأمنها للخطر؟ هل يعقل أن يدخل ساسة أمة كبيرة مثل ألمانيا في حرب بهذا الاعتقاد الساذج؟ هل أنتم جادون في ذلك؟ ﴿ أَوَ أَمِنَ أَهْلُ الْقُرَى أَن يَأْتِيَهُمْ بَأْسُنَا ضُحًى وَهُمْ يَلْعَبُونَ ۞ أَفَأَمِنُواْ مَكْرَ اللّهِ فَلاَ يَأْمَنُ مَكْرَ اللّهِ إِلاَّ الْقَوْمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ ﴾ (الأعراف :98- 99 ) إن التصويت في 27.09 يعد أكثر من اختيار بين رجل و امرأة. تقول حكمة قديمة: ""الأمن قبل كل شيء"". في النظام الديموقراطي يستطيع الشعب فقط إرجاع جنوده إلى وطنه. أما إذا أصر الشعب على الاستمرار في الحرب فإنه قد حكم على نفسه وفوق ذلك وضح بكل جلاء للعالم بأسرِهِ أن المدنيين في النظام الديموقراطي ليسوا بأبرياء. إن الانتخابات البرلمانية هي الفرصة الوحيدة للشعب لرسم سياسة البلد. لذا فإن ما قبل الانتخابات ليس كما بعد الانتخابات. عند الانتخابات يكون الفصل للشعب وأما بعد الانتخابات فلن تجد ميركل شيئا من العزاء تقوله للشعب لمدة أربع سنوات سوى الأقوال التي يعرفها الشعب الألماني جيدا. هل يريد الشعب الألماني ألا يسمع هذه العبارات المحفوظة ثانية؟ هل يريد الشعب الألماني أن ينهي الخوف والعناء؟ هل يريد الشعب الألماني أن يعيش في سلام؟ فلديه الآن الفرصة. إن الله تعالى يأمرنا في القرآن – سورة الأنفال، الآية رقم ستين - أن نعد ما نستطيع من قوة لعدونا. ولكن إذا استجاب العدو ووجد حلا سلميا يحافظ به على الأرواح البشرية، فإن الله الكريم يأمرنا أن نلطف ونعفو. قال الله الرحمن: ﴿ وَإِن جَنَحُواْ لِلسَّلْمِ فَاجْنَحْ لَهَا وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللّهِ إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ ۞ وَإِن يُرِيدُواْ أَن يَخْدَعُوكَ فَإِنَّ حَسْبَكَ اللّهُ هُوَ الَّذِيَ أَيَّدَكَ بِنَصْرِهِ وَبِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ ﴾ (الأنفال :61-61 ). إذا جنح الألمان الآن للسلم فإن المجاهدين سيجنحون للسلم كذلك وبخروج أخر جندي ألماني من أفغانستان سيُسحب آخر مجاهد من ألمانيا. هذا وعد من القاعدة. إن هذا هو التسامح الإسلامي الذي يعرفه الغرب جيدا ويمدحه كثيرا. إن الشعب الألماني يمكنه الآن أن يستفيد من هذا التسامح ويستغل الوقت المناسب. والقاعدة مستعدة وفق دستورها - القرآن الكريم - أن تغض الطرف عن الألمان. الأمر في أيديكم أنتم وحدكم. ما رأي الشعب الألماني في سحب جنوده من أفغانستان وإعطاء الفرصة بذلك للسلام والأمن في ألمانيا ثم ترك شأن أفغانستان للشعب الأفغاني. أما إذا لم يرد الشعب الألماني دفع أغلبية الأحزاب لسحب جنوده من أفغانستان فساء صباح المنذَرين. أما للمسلمين في ألمانيا فأقول: السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته: إخواني الأحباء في الله إن القاعدة تطلب منكم أن تبتعدوا عن كل ما هو ليس ضرورياً في الأسبوعين اللذين يليان الانتخابات إذا لم يقرر الشعب الألماني سحب جنوده من أفغانستان. أبقوا أولادكم بالقرب منكم في هذه الفترة. اسأل الله أن يحفظكم وأولادكم وجميع الأولاد. لشباب الإسلام أقول : إخواني في الله! إذا بدأ الجهاد في ألمانيا فاتركوا القاعدة أولاً تعمل. وإذا كانت هناك حاجة للانتقال إلى المرحلة الثانية فإننا سنخبركم بما يستطيع كل واحد منكم أن يفعله ليشارك في الجهاد في ألمانيا. مدينة كيل ستبقى مهما طال الصراع في ألمانيا مدينة آمنة. هذا وعد مني. مجملا أنصح الألمان بمبدأ للقاعدة وهو: الأمن قاسم مشترك. إذا كان ممثلو الشعب الألماني حريصين على سيادتهم وأمنهم ومبادئهم فعليهم ألا يعتبروا سيادة وأمن ومبادئ الأفغان كالهواء. آن الأوان لألمانيا أن تعلم بأن أفغانستان ليست الولاية السابعة عشر لألمانيا وليست ""خيمة البيرة"" لتقيم فيها طول السنة ""حفلة أكتوبر"". كان بإمكان ميركل أن لا تجعل الأمر يصل إلى ما آل إليه ولكنها هونت من شأن القاعدة. ﴿ فَاعْتَبِرُوا يَا أُولِي الْأَبْصَارِ ﴾ (الحشر : 2 ) لأمرائي أمير المؤمنين الملا عمر مجاهد والشيخ بن لادن والشيخ الظواهري أقول: أعدكم أنني سأبقى لعهدي وفيا وأن أبقى دوما جنديا مطيعا وبدون شروط. الملا عمر مجاهد والشيخ بن لادن والشيخ الظواهري إني أحبكم في الله. ﴿فِي بِضْعِ سِنِينَ لِلَّهِ الْأَمْرُ مِن قَبْلُ وَمِن بَعْدُ وَيَوْمَئِذٍ يَفْرَحُ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ ۞ بِنَصْرِ اللَّهِ يَنصُرُ مَن يَشَاءُ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ ۞ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ لَا يُخْلِفُ اللَّهُ وَعْدَهُ وَلَكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ﴾ (الروم :4-5- 6 ) والسلام على من اتبع الهدى...إن ميركل أدت عند توليها منصب المستشارة اليمين الدستوري التالي :""أقسم بأن أبذل كل جهدي من أجل راحة الشعب الألماني، وأن أنَمِّيَ نفعه، وأن أبعد عنه الضرر، وأن أحفظ وأدافع عن الدستور وقوانين الدولة، و أن أؤدي واجباتي بصدق، وأن أكون عادلة مع كل أحد"". إن الله القوي يقول : ﴿أَفَرَأَيْتَ الَّذِي تَوَلَّى{33} وَأَعْطَى قَلِيلاً وَأَكْدَى{34} أَعِندَهُ عِلْمُ الْغَيْبِ فَهُوَ يَرَى{35} أَمْ لَمْ يُنَبَّأْ بِمَا فِي صُحُفِ مُوسَى{36} وَإِبْرَاهِيمَ الَّذِي وَفَّى{37} أَلَّا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى{38} وَأَن لَّيْسَ لِلْإِنسَانِ إِلَّا مَا سَعَى{39} وَأَنَّ سَعْيَهُ سَوْفَ يُرَى{40} ثُمَّ يُجْزَاهُ الْجَزَاء الْأَوْفَى{41} وَأَنَّ إِلَى رَبِّكَ الْمُنتَهَى{42} وَأَنَّهُ هُوَ أَضْحَكَ وَأَبْكَى{43} وَأَنَّهُ هُوَ أَمَاتَ وَأَحْيَا{44} وَأَنَّهُ خَلَقَ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالْأُنثَى{45} مِن نُّطْفَةٍ إِذَا تُمْنَى{46} وَأَنَّ عَلَيْهِ النَّشْأَةَ الْأُخْرَى{47} وَأَنَّهُ هُوَ أَغْنَى وَأَقْنَى{48} وَأَنَّهُ هُوَ رَبُّ الشِّعْرَى{49} وَأَنَّهُ أَهْلَكَ عَاداً الْأُولَى{50} وَثَمُودَ فَمَا أَبْقَى{51} وَقَوْمَ نُوحٍ مِّن قَبْلُ إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا هُمْ أَظْلَمَ وَأَطْغَى{52} وَالْمُؤْتَفِكَةَ أَهْوَى{53} فَغَشَّاهَا مَا غَشَّى{54} فَبِأَيِّ آلَاء رَبِّكَ تَتَمَارَى{55} هَذَا نَذِيرٌ مِّنَ النُّذُرِ الْأُولَى{56} أَزِفَتْ الْآزِفَةُ{57} لَيْسَ لَهَا مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ كَاشِفَةٌ{58} أَفَمِنْ هَذَا الْحَدِيثِ تَعْجَبُونَ{59} وَتَضْحَكُونَ وَلَا تَبْكُونَ{60} وَأَنتُمْ سَامِدُونَ{61} فَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ وَاعْبُدُوا{62}﴾ (النجم :33- 62 ) الحرب يعلنها طرف واحد وأما السلم فلا يتم إلا من الطرفين معاً القاعدة ادعوا لإخوانكم المجاهدين إخوانكم في مركزالفجرللإعلام رمضان1430هـ",2009,09,18,2009-09-18 00:00:00.000,38887

17711,38946,13341,Al-Fajr: &quot;Security ... a shared destiny&quot;  By Al Hafidh Abu Talha The German,932,Abu Fatima,"Summary from the Kuffar: Quote: Al- Qaeda tells Germany to change government Afghanistan is not the seventeenth province of Germany and it is not the 'beer tent' where to hold the 'Oktoberfest', said Abu Talha. Published: September 18, 2009 Al-Qaeda warned Germans on Friday to change their government in the September 27 election, saying they will face a ""bad awakening"" if they do not, according to two intelligence monitoring services. Germany was also told to withdraw its 4,200 troops from Afghanistan or face being attacked at home, the US-based groups said. In video footage a man identified as Abu Talha the German, and speaking in German, says that if Chancellor Angela Merkel is re-elected, ""bitter times await the Germans,"" according to IntelCenter and the SITE Intelligence Group. He asks: ""Mrs Merkel, what is the logical outcome reaped by the British and Spanish conservatives by their support for the Iraq war?"" in an apparent reference to attacks in Madrid and London in 2004 and 2005. He appears to suggest that if German voters do not heed his warnings, Al-Qaeda will act within a fortnight. Germany's interior ministry said on Friday there was an increased risk of attacks on German soil ahead of the elections, and said security at airports and train stations had been boosted. Addressing German Muslims Abu Talha says: ""Al-Qaeda asks you to stay away from all that is not necessary in the two weeks that follow the elections, if the German people does not decide to withdraw its soldiers from Afghanistan. Keep your children near you in this period."" Abu Talha, whose real name is said to be Bekkay Harrach, stands in front of a red backdrop, wearing a jacket and tie. He is said by the German authorities to be a native of Morocco, and in his early 30s, who has lived intermittently in Bonn and is now thought to be in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area. In the footage he asks Muslim youths in Germany to let Al-Qaeda act first if the jihad were to begin in Germany, and says they will be told if action is required afterwards. He also said the city of Kiel ""will remain a peaceful city, no matter how long the conflict."" Abu Talha says that if Germany withdraws from Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda will no longer target it. ""If the Germans are inclined now towards peace, then the mujahideen will be inclined towards peace, as well. With the departure of the last German soldier from Afghanistan, the last mujahid in Germany will be withdrawn. ""It is time for Germany to know that Afghanistan is not the seventeenth province of Germany and that it is not the 'beer tent' where to hold the 'Oktoberfest' throughout the year,"" he added. The authenticity of the nearly 26-minute video cannot be independently verified. Abu Talha first appeared in a video entitled ""Germany’s Rescue Plan"" from Al-Qaeda’s media arm, As-Sahab, on January 17. In that video, he also threatened reprisals if Germany did not withdraw from Afghanistan. He said Germans were ""gullible and naive"" if they thought they ""were going to get off without injury when they are the third (largest) occupying force in Afghanistan"" after the Americans and the British. He later dictated an audio message that was released on February 26 and was entitled ""Islam and the Financial Crisis."" Conservative German Chancellor Angela Merkel appears to be on track for re-election, although an opinion poll published on Friday showed her lead to be shrinking.

Kim Grunberger of The Army Operational Command said the troops were patrolling on foot in Afghanistan's Helmand province when they came under attack from insurgents. The wounded soldier was flown to a field hospital for treatment. Denmark has now lost 25 soldiers in Afghanistan since it joined the U.S.-led coalition in 2002. One US and one Canadian soldier from the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) have reportedly lost their lives in separate roadside bombing attacks in southern Afghanistan. US military spokeswoman Captain Elizabeth Mathias said the American trooper died Thursday when his patrol struck an improvised explosive device in southern Afghanistan. She disclosed no further details about the location of the incident and withheld the soldier's identity, pending notification of his next of kin. The latest death brought to 838 the number of American soldiers killed in Afghanistan since the US-led war to overthrow the Taliban regime in 2001. there have been 208 American casualties in Afghanistan this year alone. This is while the top Canadian military commander in Afghanistan, Brigadier General Jonathan Vance, confirmed the death of Private Jonathan Couturier, 23, on Thursday. The deceased soldier was returning from an anti-Taliban mission when his patrol vehicle hit a bomb in the troubled southern province of Kandahar.",2009,09,20,2009-09-20 00:00:00.000,2051

17868,39166,1893,Latest News About The Mujahideen In Somalia,930,wa1slama,"Emboldened Al-Shabab Warns Djibouti Not to Send Troops to Somalia By Alan Boswell Friday, September 18, 2009 Nairobi, Kenya - A day after a brazen suicide attack in the African Union peacekeeper base in Mogadishu, Somali rebel Islamic group al-Shabab threatens neighboring Djibouti that a similar fate awaits its troops should they be sent to Somalia. The attack Thursday killed 21. The spokesman for the radical Islamist militant group al-Shabab, Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage, warned the government of Djibouti against sending any forces to Somalia as part of the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia, known as AMISOM. He says that their troops should expect the same reception given to the Ugandan and Burundian soldiers killed Thursday if they too enter the country. Rage asserts that his group is already angered by the access to Djibouti's airports and seaports given to foreign governments. Earlier this month the Djibouti ambassador to the U.S. told VOA's Somali service that it would be sending troops to Somalia to serve in AMISOM, though the ambassador declined to say how many or when. The AMISOM spokesman in Nairobi has confirmed to VOA that the suicide bombings Thursday successfully attacked a senior meeting between AMISOM's military leadership and officials of the Western-backed transitional federal government. Seventeen peacekeepers were killed as well as four Somali civilians, who were inside the military base for the meeting. The spokesman for the prime minister of Somalia told reporters Friday that the high-level government officials were killed and wounded in the attack. Among the dead in the blasts was deputy commander of the AMISOM forces and the top Burundian officer in Somalia, General Juvenal Niyoyunguruza. The head general, a Ugandan, was wounded. Subsequent mortar attacks in the capital city later Wednesday reportedly killed at least 19 civilians. The two vehicles used by the suicide attackers carried the United Nations logo on their sides. The Somali government claims that the vehicles were likely two of eight stolen U.N. cars believed to have fallen in the hands of the Islamic rebels. AMISOM says that the two vehicles were allowed in to the compound because they were marked U.N. cars. Once inside, one of the cars flew to the nearby petrol station and blew up, and the other one exploded inside the base near the Mogadishu airport. The United Nations was not part of the high level meeting. The successful execution of such a boldly planned strike is a clear blow to the government led by President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, which has lost significant ground to the Islamic opposition fighters. It is unclear whether al-Shabab specifically planned the attack with full knowledge of the meeting taking place. Many on the government side used to fight side-by-side with current rebel fighters as part of the Islamic insurgency against Ethiopia's 2006 invasion, and weaponry is believed to pass easily through the government army's hands to the opposition fighters. Djibouti, a former French colony, is 60 percent made up of ethnic Somalis and is heavily Muslim. The country hosted the peace meetings that eventually led to the formation of the transitional government and the election of President Sharif, a former leader of the Islamic insurgency, earlier this year. A group of Islamic rebels, including al-Shabab, have rejected the U.N.-backed deal and holds that the government is illegitimate. The opposition fighters now control most of Mogadishu as well as much of the country. The AMISOM forces in Somalia are composed of about 5,000 Ugandan and Burundian troops.

17942,39305,13341,Al-Fajr: &quot;Security ... a shared destiny&quot;  By Al Hafidh Abu Talha The German,1743,yuma,"Assalamu alaikum Quote: Al Qaeda warns Germany A senior al Qaeda leader has threatened to attack Germany just days before the nation will go to the polls to choose a new Chancellor. Bekkay Harrach, alias Al Hafidh Abu Talha al Almani, resurfaced Friday in a chilling new video produced by al Qaeda's al Fajr Media Center and distributed across the major jihadi Web forums. Dressed in an ill-fitting black blazer, blue tie, and shoulder-length greased hair - looking more like a teenager dressed for his first job interview - he slammed Germany for its military presence in Afghanistan and warned that if Chancellor Angela Merkel is reelected on Sept. 27, Germany will be directly attacked. His previous warning to Germany, on Jan. 17, 2009, coincided with a massive car bomb attack on the heavily guarded German embassy in Kabul that was orchestrated by the notorious Haqqani Network. Four Afghan civilians and an American soldier died in the attack. ""The vote on September 27 is more than a choice between a man and a woman,"" he warned in the new video, which was acquired by the Long War Journal. ""As an old aphorism says, 'Security is foremost.' In the democratic system, only the people can return the soldiers to their homeland. If the people insist on continuing the war (in Afghanistan), they sentence themselves to retaliation and clearly show the world that civilians in the democratic system are not innocent people."" He addressed Germany's Muslim community and said ""(S)tay clear of all that is not necessary in the two weeks of the elections if the German people did not decide to withdraw its soldiers from Afghanistan. Keep your children near you at this time. Ask God to bless you and your children."" ""The city of Kiel,"" he continued inexplicably, ""will remain a safe city no matter how long the conflict in Germany. This is a promise from me."" He reminded viewers of the attacks in Madrid and London and, addressing the German chancellor, asked ""Lady Merkel, what is the logical outcome earned by British Conservatives and the Spaniards for their support for the Iraq war? Why is Germany involved in the war on Afghanistan? The Afghan people did nothing to the German people and the Mujahideen have not done anything to the German people."" At one point in his speech he also mentioned the Mumbai attacks, but it is unclear if his reference relates to the 2008 siege or to the bombings in 2006, which like those in Madrid and London targeted the city's busy railway. ""God commands us in the Qur'an - Al-Anfal, verse sixty - that we must do what we can to force our enemy to surrender,"" he stated. ""But if the enemy can find a peaceful solution... the Holy Qur'an commands us to forgive."" According to his statement, Germany's only option to avoid an attack is to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan. If Germany does so, he said, al Qaeda will withdraw from Germany. ""This is a promise from al Qaeda. This is the tolerant Islam that the West knows well and praises so much. The German people can now take advantage of this tolerance and use the appropriate time. Al-Qaeda is ready according to its constitution, the Qur'an, to turn a blind eye on Germany. It is now in your hands and your hands alone."" Germany cannot count on the United States for protection, he said. Germany does not have the benefit of the Atlantic Ocean as a buffer against al Qaeda fighters as the US does. As evidence, he pointed to the disruption of the Sauderland Group, which plotted attacks on Ramstein Air Base and Frankfurt International Airport but was discovered in September 2007. Four members of the cell, who trained with the Islamic Jihad Union in Pakistan, are now on trial in Germany. ""The Sauerland cell was not detected until after German security was alerted by the Americans. The Americans cannot always save the Germans. German security does not have the power to protect the Germans at all."" This is Harrach’s third propaganda address since January. His previous statements were produced by As Sahab, the main studio for al Qaeda senior leadership, a sign that suggests he has taken on an increasingly senior role in the terror organization. German authorities unmasked him in the press after he appeared hidden behind a black turban in his first video, ""Rescue Plan for Germany."" Bekkay Harrach, al Qaeda’s new external operations chief? Harrach is a 32-year-old Moroccan whose family emigrated to Germany when he was two years old; he became a naturalized German citizen in 1997. According to reports, the Sept. 11 attacks on the US energized him on Islamist causes. In 2003, he traveled to the West Bank and was injured during a skirmish with Israeli troops. Authorities believe that he traveled twice to Iraq in an attempt to join al Qaeda. An effort was made to recruit him to spy for Germany but failed. He took university courses in laser technology and business mathematics but dropped out in 2004. He then worked part-time at the Muhadshirin Mosque in Bonn, where he ultimately met al Qaeda scout Aleem Nasir and received a letter of recommendation that opened doors to the terror network's training camps. In 2007, using Nasir's letter, Harrach followed smuggling routes to Waziristan through Turkey and Iran and was finally assigned to train under the network's then-operations chief for global strikes, Abu Ubaidah al Masri. He narrowly escaped an airstrike in February 2008 that targeted Ubaidah. Ubaidah survived the strike but later died from complications due to hepatitis. Since that attack, Harrach has become a rising star in al Qaeda's new generation and is reportedly on its shura council for global strikes. Reports suggest that his travels are tracked by intelligence agencies, however, according to Spiegel Online, he is directly protected by Siraj Haqqani and his deadly network. Harrach is rumored to excel at planning major attacks. ""If we want to do something,"" a source in the Haqqani Network told Spiegel, ""we always ask the German for his opinion."" The Haqqani Network is blamed for the attack on the German embassy in Kabul that coincided with Harrach's initial video. Its ties with the Islamic Jihad Union, which is implicated in the foiled 2007 attack on Ramstein and is suspected of maintaining a presence in Germany, are strong. Although unconfirmed, his high-profile appearances in al Qaeda propaganda suggest that he may have succeeded Abu Sulayman Jazairi as al Qaeda's operations chief for global strikes. Jazairi was killed in a May 2008 airstrike in Pakistan. The latest video by Harrach is most striking because its themes and packaging are targeted almost exclusively for a Western audience. Speaking softly in fluent German, without the usual militant or religious props featured in past al Qaeda messages, he stares directly into the camera and only occasionally looks down to turn over the pages of his speech. He never wags his finger or raises his voice. The video carries no subtitling in Arabic. The only visual hint to the nature of the tape - other than the obligatory title screen and occasional nasheeds that espouse militancy - are the dark circles under his eyes. Mirroring his previous messages, German economic problems are offered as an argument for heeding his call for a troop withdrawal. He does not dwell on religious justifications for the attack. Harrach acknowledged assistance he has received from German authorities over the years and explained that his warning was in return for their acts of good faith. ""I thank Germany for its assistance quickly to get me out of prison in Syria,"" he said. ""I thank Germany for its help me when my injury in the city of Hebron in Palestine. I thank Germany for it did not hurt my family after my trip to Afghanistan, nor prevent them from traveling (to rejoin me), despite long-term surveillance. Since the reward for good in Islam is charity, today I will show my gratitude."" The increasing tempo of propaganda messaging specifically directed at Germany has alarmed authorities. The militant Web forums have been buzzing for months with talk about a ""German 9/11,"" and statements from other jihadis have been published or released in German. The timing of his previous threat with an actual attack against German interests is not comforting. The Interior Ministry acknowledged the ""increased threat situation"" immediately following the release of the tape and announced that ""adjusted security measures in particular at airports and stations"" are now in effect. http://www.longwarjournal.org/archiv...arns_germa.php Wa alaikum assalam",2009,09,19,2009-09-19 00:00:00.000,38887

18120,39615,13486,Youth Mujahideen Movement: &quot;Here I am at Your Service O' Usama&quot;,12,Insurgent,"By ELIZABETH A. KENNEDY, Associated Press Writer Elizabeth A. Kennedy, Associated Press Writer – 1 hr 6 mins ago NAIROBI, Kenya – An Islamic insurgent group that controls much of this lawless nation has released a video showing its members vowing allegiance to Osama bin Laden, training in dusty camps and slamming Somalia's U.S.-backed president as a traitor. The tape was released late Sunday by al-Shabab, an insurgent group that last week hit the African Union peacekeeping base with suicide car bombs, killing 21 people in the deadliest single attack on peacekeepers since they arrived in 2007. Al-Shabab announced the Thursday attack at Mogadishu's airport was in retaliation for a U.S. commando raid on Sept. 14 that killed al-Qaida operative Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan in southern Somalia. The United States has become increasingly concerned that al-Qaida insurgents are moving into anarchic Somalia, where they can mobilize recruits without interference. The video showed the Shabab militia in training, leaping over piles of sandbags, crawling on the ground and shooting at targets. White-skinned bearded trainers could be seen moving among the Somalis. The video also showed crowds chanting: ""At your service Osama!"" Sheik Hassan Ya'qub, a spokesman for al-Shabab, said the video is ""aimed at showing how the youth are well-trained and ready to the defend their holy land."" Shabab means ""youth"" in Arabic. Bin Laden has declared his support for Somali insurgents before. The new video shows the mutual affection is strong as ever — a growing concern for U.S. and other governments. Al-Qaida bombed the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, killing more than 200 people, and one of the alleged plotters is believed to be hiding out in Somalia. Stronger ties between al-Qaida and al-Shabab could pose greater threats to Western interests in the region. The video features periodic commentary from a voice purported to be bin Laden's, criticizing the administration of Somali President Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed as un-Islamic for its ties to America. Sharif met last month with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who pledged to expand American support for Somalia's government. The comments from the al-Qaida leader echo comments of support he made in March. It was not immediately clear if they were from the same recording. Ahmed, a moderate Islamist, was elected president in January and hopes to unite the country's feuding factions. ""How can intelligent people believe that yesterday's enemies, on the basis of religion, can become today's friends?"" the voice purported to be bin Laden's said in a voice-over as his photo was shown. Somalia has been ravaged by violence and anarchy since warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991 and turned on each other. Piracy has flourished off the Somali coast, making the Gulf of Aden one of the most dangerous waterways in the world. On Sunday, insurgents attacked a town near the border with Ethiopia, killing at least 10 people, witnesses and officials said. ___ Associated Press Writer Mohamed Olad Hassan in Mogadishu, Somalia contributed to this report.",2009,09,21,2009-09-21 00:00:00.000,39390

Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda, has called on the U.S. government to reinforce military plans to boost AMISOM peacekeepers in Somalia in order to safeguard the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in Mogadishu from collapse. President Museveni, who is in New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly, was addressing reporters after meeting with U.S. Ambassador the U.N., Dr. Susan Rice. “The interest of Uganda is to ensure total peace in Somalia,” President Museveni said, according to the Ugandan newspaper, Daily Monitor. The Ugandan leader called for AMISOM peacekeepers to reach the authorized force of 8,000 soldiers, some of which would be deployed in the key towns of Kismayo and Baidoa. Currently, Kismayo and Baidoa remain under the control of Al Shabaab, the strongest insurgent faction in Somalia. The 5,000-strong AMISOM peacekeeping force consists of Ugandan and Burundian soldiers. Many African countries that have pledged to boost the peacekeepers in Mogadishu have not lived up to earlier promises. On Sep. 17, Al Shabaab suicide car bombers struck the AMISOM force headquarters at Mogadishu's international airport, killing at least 21 people. It was the deadliest attack on the African peacekeepers since AMISOM deployed in Mogadishu in March 2007. Source: Garowe Online",2009,09,23,2009-09-23 00:00:00.000,3545

The leader held press conference through the telephone and said that he was greatly against yesterday’s statement from the Islamic administration of Kismayu town for uniting with the other administrations in Jubba regions which manned by Harakat Al-shabab Mujahideen. Sheik Hassan Turki also said in his press conference that there was a promise between his administration and Harakat Al-shabab Mujahideen for sharing the administration of Kismayu town which he pointed out it was halted adding that the port town of Kismayu was jointly captured by Harakat Al-shabab Mujahideen, Raskanboni and Anole. He reiterated that he will never recognize the new administration which announce in Kismayu on Wednesday saying that it seemed to him that the promise of powers who captured the town earlier was totally disproved. “I don’t believe or recognize and I will also not believe the new administration in Kismayu town. We see it that it was built by only one clan so it does not represent all the other clans who agreed together earlier,” Sheik Hassan said. The statement of the Islamist leader Sheik Hassan Abdullahi Hersi known as (Turki) comes as the spokesman of Kismayu town administration Sheik Hassan Ya’qub Ali said Wednesday that they had united with the other Islamic administrations in Jubba regions and led by Harakat Al-shabab Mujahideen.

Sheikh Hassan Yakub, spokesman for Al Shabaab administrators in Kismayo, told reporters Wednesday that the Ugandan leader's plan to deploy African Union peacekeepers (AMISOM) to Kismayo and Baidoa is aimed at ""misleading"" the international community. Al Shabaab: ""He [Ugandan President] wants to gain project funds from the international community,"" said Sheikh Yakub, who was speaking at a press conference in Kismayo. According to the spokesman, the Al Shabaab administration in Kismayo has formally changed its name to the ""Islamic Walaayah of Jubba."" It is not clear whether or not all armed factions in Kismayo agree with this new name, but a political dispute has been brewing over the administration of Kismayo in recent months. Kismayo was seized in Aug. 2008 by a coalition of clan militias and Islamist fighters, including Al Shabaab, Ras Kamboni and Anole. While Ras Kamboni and Anole merged with other factions to form Hizbul Islam in early 2009, Al Shabaab has remained fiercely independent and has maintained an iron-grip control in Kismayo. Inside sources say Hizbul Islam political leaders have been attempting to mediate between Al Shabaab and the Ras Kamboni-Anole alliance. While Al Shabaab is a multi-clan faction that primarily draws support from the outside, Ras Kamboni and Anole draw support from the local Darod clans in Middle Jubba and Lower Jubba regions.

However as allways, we should view with suspicion everything the anti-jihadi media writes, however if it is true we should all condemn this and ask Allah (swt) to guide those who did this. wa alaykum as salaam akhi, I believe this is referring to a famous recent case of the so called ""dancer"" who was in fact one of many a professional prostitutes working in that area. With regards to killing these vile and filthy women, then if you research books of fiqh, you will find that it is permissible for a qaadhi or a haakim to apply the hadd punishment upon such prostitutes which is ""suitable"" to their particular situation. So as I have mentioned before on the forum, the sahaabah would cut the hand of a common thief........but they would execute highwaymen and bandits [bughaat] due to the effect of the latter being more damaging than the common theif. Similarly, a NON PROSTITUTE woman who is married is stoned to death for fornication, and a single woman is lashed or imprisoned/banished etc for fornication depending upon the situation and judgement of the qaadhee. As for when the filthy prositute woman fornicates for money, then this crime is FAR WORSE that the sin of fornicating due to hawaa'..... thus you will find the fuqahaa' of the Salaf being far more harsh in their punishments then they are with a faasiqah Muslimah who followed her hawaa' for exmaple. I agree with our noble brother lalaje, that is incorrect to condemn a hadd punishment which the Scholars of swat have issued upon someone, as we here in cyberspace do not know all the details of the case of this particular filthy woman. It is quite permissible for the qaadhee or haakim to sentence to death a bandit, drug dealer, pimp, or professional prostitute, or deviant, if that is the most suitable sentence. As we know, there is scope in the Sharee'ah huddood [prescribed punishments] for leniency for those who deserve leniency, and harshness for those who deserve harshness, just as the noble Salaf used to vary in their rulings accordingly. If you research the issue of ""prostitutes"" who will find very harsh rulings from many of the Imaams of the Salaf so do NOT be suprised insha'Allah. May Allah guide such women to repent, and may Allah reward the Scholars of swat area for their ijtihaad in such difficult times of fitnah.

With regards to killing these vile and filthy women, then if you research books of fiqh, you will find that it is permissible for a qaadhi or a haakim to apply the hadd punishment upon such prostitutes which is ""suitable"" to their particular situation. So as I have mentioned before on the forum, the sahaabah would cut the hand of a common thief........but they would execute highwaymen and bandits [bughaat] due to the effect of the latter being more damaging than the common theif. Similarly, a NON PROSTITUTE woman who is married is stoned to death for fornication, and a single woman is lashed or imprisoned/banished etc for fornication depending upon the situation and judgement of the qaadhee. As for when the filthy prositute woman fornicates for money, then this crime is FAR WORSE that the sin of fornicating due to hawaa'..... thus you will find the fuqahaa' of the Salaf being far more harsh in their punishments then they are with a faasiqah Muslimah who followed her hawaa' for exmaple. I agree with our noble brother lalaje, that is incorrect to condemn a hadd punishment which the Scholars of swat have issued upon someone, as we here in cyberspace do not know all the details of the case of this particular filthy woman. It is quite permissible for the qaadhee or haakim to sentence to death a bandit, drug dealer, pimp, or professional prostitute, or deviant, if that is the most suitable sentence. As we know, there is scope in the Sharee'ah huddood [prescribed punishments] for leniency for those who deserve leniency, and harshness for those who deserve harshness, just as the noble Salaf used to vary in their rulings accordingly. If you research the issue of ""prostitutes"" who will find very harsh rulings from many of the Imaams of the Salaf so do NOT be suprised insha'Allah. May Allah guide such women to repent, and may Allah reward the Scholars of swat area for their ijtihaad in such difficult times of fitnah. And Allah knows best. was salaam. Aleikum selam brother First of all, you said Quote: Similarly, a NON PROSTITUTE woman who is married is stoned to death for fornication, and a single woman is lashed or imprisoned/banished etc for fornication depending upon the situation and judgement of the qaadhee. How can a married women commit fornication? Isnt this adultery which is punished by stoning to death? Maybe you meant a prostitute who is not married should be stoned to death for her crime which is greater than a non-prostitute commiting fornication? Can you explain more about what you meant. Secondly I allways taught this women was a ""dancer"". By that I mean a women who is dancing half-naked, in front of men and in most cases it is money involved. As for this, I objected to execution. For example in practically every ""western"" based hotell in muslim countries we have such dancers. I have been in Egypt and in hotels in Cairo they have these dancers who are dancing all the night in front of others, and they call them belly-dancers. So I taught the women in the article were dancers who were dancing half-naked in front of other people. It never said in the article they were prostitutes! So I am asking if this is the case, that we can kill them for simply dancing, why dont the scholars issue fatwas that we can kill all those dancers in the hotels and other places which we for surely find in muslim countries. And if these dancers should be killed, what about the female singers then??? They are clearly much worse because they are taped and their singing and dancing can be seen by millions over the Television and Internet! Such as the shia singer from Lebanon, I am not going to mention her name because she isnt worth of even mentioning her name, but do you believe she and all other female singers/dancers should be killed? So are you making a division between singers and prostitutes, so that prostitutes should be killed but dancers not? Or do you mean that all female dancers should be killed?",2009,09,26,2009-09-26 00:00:00.000,40181

Fighters loyal to Ras Kamboni Brigade and Anole have poured into Kismayo, forcing the bulk of Al Shabaab guerrillas to peacefully leave the port town overnight Saturday, local sources told Puntland-based Radio Garowe. Some Al Shabaab elements are still in control of the police station and the city is calm, the sources added. Al Shabaab fighters have regrouped in the agricultural town of Jamame, located north of Kismayo, but also in Lower Jubba region. Ras Kamboni and Anole are part of four factions that merged to form Hizbul Islam in Feb. 2009, with Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys as chairman. Sheikh Hassan ""Turki"" Abdullahi, the leader of Ras Kamboni, is the deputy chairman of Hizbul Islam faction. Sheikh Ahmed ""Madobe"" Mohamed, a key ally of Sheikh Turki, led Hizbul Islam fighters into Kismayo and seized control of key locations of the town. In recent days, Sheikh Turki has publicly opposed Al Shabaab's declaration of an administration in Kismayo that excludes other powerful groups, namely Ras Kamboni and Anole. Both Ras Kamboni and Anole represent local clans, who fought alongside Al Shabaab to overthrow warlord Barre Hirale in Aug. 2008.

18976,41001,13656,"What a ""Islamic Army"".......?opening  cinemas and  shrines in Swat",139,Thunderman,"Brother yuma Esselamu aleikum I dont know wheather islamqa is a trustworthy site because it is known they have taken the stand of the minority in many issues and they are clearly blind following saudi scholars, especially the three references which they clearly are blind following, namely 1. Fataawa al Lainah Daimah 2. Ibn Baaz 3. Ibn Uthaymeen So because of their blindly following of them they have taken the stance of the minority in many issues and havent even showed the evidence of the other side, rather only of their side and then said it is the correct scholarly opinion. An example of this is the issues of neglecting prayer wheather it is kuffr or not and photography wheather it is allowed or not. As for the female voice, then we know it is permissible for women to speech to other men, of course without Fitnah being involved. So perhaps they view singing as different than speeching? Edit, I found a fatwa which seems trusthworthy from a professor at Al-Azhar university Here it is: Quote: Question As-Salam `alaykum! I would like to know if it is permissible for men to sing in front of women? Answer Wa `alaykum As-Salamu wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh. In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. All praise and thanks are due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger. Dear questioner, thanks for your question, which reflects a true desire to get knowledge about Islam and its guidance. In the very beginning, we'd like to note that Islam closes the door before every mischievous act and blocks all things leading to vice and seduction. In this context, it says no to the voice of both men and women in cases that may lead to fitnahor temptation. Responding to the question, the late Sheikh Ahmad Ash-Sharabasi, Professor of Islamic creed at Al-Azhar University , states the following: There is nothing in Islam to say that a man cannot sing so long as his singing does not involve any unlawful thing or immoral themes. As long as the song is pure and positive and has a good message to deliver, there is nothing wrong with it. It is recorded that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) witnessed a man called Anjashah while he was leading the caravan and singing. He did not reproach him; rather, encouraged him. To many jurists, a man's singing is rather more acceptable than a woman’s singing, since a man's voice is naturally not that soft and thus, not leading to mischief or seduction. A man is not allowed to listen to a woman's singing. However, it is allowable for women to sing in front of one another in events like weddings. Also allowable is the singing of a husband in front of his wife and vice versa. Based on the above fatwa, it is clear that it is allowable for men to sing in front of women since man's voice is not that soft and so long as the song has a good message and the words are pure. So basically it is permissible for women to sing in front of other women, but not in front of men. However this is applied only to non-mahrams since it is permissible for a women to sing in front of her housband.",2009,09,28,2009-09-28 00:00:00.000,40181

The fighting erupted Monday morning after government forces entered Beletwein from two directions and clashed with Hizbul Islam rebels. Most of the fighting was concentrated at the center of Beletwein, the provincial capital of Hiran region, including the town's central administration building and the police station. There were no reliable reports of casualties but at least 1 civilian was wounded during the armed clashes, which stopped after Hizbul Islam rebels withdrew from Beletwein. Hundreds of people poured onto the streets afterwards to watch Somali government forces take full control of the town's key areas, including the main bridge that connects Beletwein's eastern and western neighborhoods. 'Looting' A second round of fighting erupted midday Monday after Somali government troops rolled into Beletwein's western neighorborhoods. The fighting started after gunmen loyal to businesspeople in west Beletwein began fighting the government troops, whom they accused of ""looting"" local businesses. At least 4 Somali soldiers were wounded during Monday's second battle, including a senior military commander named Salad Hared, according to government sources. Currently, government troops and the militias are facing off across Beletwein's main bridge and sporadic gunfire could still be heard inside the town. Local sources said there were ""more casualties"" during the second round of fighting, but the reports could be independently verified. Meanwhile, there is no information as to the whereabouts of Sheikh Abdirahman Ibrahim Ma'ow, the Islamist governor of Hiran region who switched loyalty from the Somali government to Hizbul Islam rebels last week. Somali government forces were accused of looting businesses in west Beletwein last month when they seized control of the town from insurgents.

The transitional government troops made bases in different parties of the town over the past two days as they had forcibly taken over its control from the Islamist fighters led by Sheik Abdirahman Ibrahim Ma’ow, the former governor of Hiran region who recently joined the Islamist organization of Hizbul Islam. Reports say that the troops left from Beledweyn town and headed to the side of Elgal village about 15 kilometers south of the town, a former centre for the government soldiers in Hiran region in central Somalia. Residents confirmed the journalists that they could see more government troops with heavy armed vehicles vacating from the town. It is yet unclear the aim that the troops left from the town. But some reports indicate that more fighters armed heavily battle wagons led by the former governor of Hiran region Sheik Abdirahman Ibrahim Ma’ow are heading to the town which seems was the reason that the government troops vacated it on Wednesday morning.

19254,41532,13864,Breaking News: Somalia: Al Shabaab withdraw from Kismayo,117,ShabaabQoqaz,"Quote: Somalia's al Shabaab rebels declare war on rivals Wed Sep 30, 2009 8:40am GMT By Mohamed Ahmed and Abdi Sheikh MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somalia's al Shabaab rebels said on Wednesday they would fight rival Hizbul Islam militants for control of the southern port of Kismayu, and residents said the insurgents had started digging trenches. Kismayu port is a lucrative source of taxes and other income for the Islamist fighters, who are also battling the fragile U.N.-backed government in the failed Horn of Africa state. Western security analysts say Somalia has become a safe haven for militants, including foreign jihadists, and Washington accuses al Shabaab of being al Qaeda's proxy in the country. Relations between al Shabaab and one-time allies Hizbul Islam degenerated last week after al Shabaab named its own local council to run Kismayu, excluding Hizbul members. Until then, the two groups had controlled the port in an uneasy coalition. Last Thursday, a Hizbul leader said they would not recognise the new administration, and both sides rushed in reinforcements. ""We have decided to fight the group that invaded our town. It is jihad,"" Sheikh Hassan Yaqub, the al Shabaab spokesman, told reporters in Kismayu. ""This group has brought back all the evil acts we banned: killing, looting, drugs, unveiled women. Instead of fighting the infidels ... they came to destroy our Islamic authority."" The international community wants to bolster President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed's government, which controls only parts of the nation's central region and a few districts of Mogadishu. Violence in Somalia has killed more than 18,000 civilians since the start of 2007 and driven 1.5 million from their homes. ""Residents should stop hesitating,"" Yaqub said. ""They should follow us and join the jihad. Otherwise, let them join Hizbul Islam and we will fight them all. is this kuffar propaganda??",2009,09,30,2009-09-30 00:00:00.000,40917

19293,41597,13486,"Youth Mujahideen Movement: ""Here I am at Your Service O' Usama""",1762,Bearer of the Sword,"Assalamu alaykum, I think this ongoing debate regarding pledging allegiance solely to Shaykh Mullah Muhammad Umar Mujahid(HA) is null and void in the first place. Derived from my little understanding of Shariah(Allaah forgive my mistakes),I would like to clarify this issue as follows : 1.When Mullah Muhammad Umar Mujahid(HA) and his honorable associates declared their Islamic Emirate in the mid 1990s,they were careful enough to name it Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.Thus its total authority and right to leadership is confined to Afghanistan and its natives,and to the muhajireen who performed hijrah for Afghanistan like Shaykh Usama ibn Ladin(HA) and other Afghan-based Qaaidah al Jihad commanders,as well as those from outside its borders,who 'chose' to consider him as Ameer ul Momineen,like almost the full spectrum of all mujahideen in Pakistan. This honorable Emirate never declared itself the Khilafah. As according to the ijma of the scholars of the Ummah,the sahih(authentic) hadith that akhi Greenbird mentions,is only regarding pledging allegiance to the Khalifa,not to a regional Ameer.So when Mullah Muhammad Umar Mujahid(HA) is referred as Ameer ul Momineen,its regarding the above mentioned subjects. 2.The same can be said about The Islamic State of Iraq.Shaykh Abu Umar al Huseyni al Qureishi al Baghdadi(HA) was declared the Ameer ul Momineen. Again his total authority is confined to Iraq and its natives,the muhajireen who came to Iraq,as well as as those from outside its borders,who 'chose' to consider him as Ameer ul Momineen,like the various jihadi groups of as Sham and Ghazza.Exactly the same resoning can be applied regarding the Caucasus Emirate and their honorable Ameer,Shaykh Abu Usman Dokku Umarov(HA). 3.As is known by the ijma of the scholars of the Ummah,in the absence of a Khilafah,independent emirates are Islamically legal. But efforts must be made to form one unified Khilafah.These efforts are fard,but there is no uniform opinion whether this is fard al ayn ,or fard al kiffayah. Shaykh ul Islam Ibn Taymiyyah(RA)says ------ “It is obligatory to know that the office in charge of commanding over the people (ie: the post of the Khaleefah) is one of the greatest obligations of the Deen. In fact, there is no establishment of the Deen except by it....this is the opinion of the salaf, such as al-Fadl ibn 'Iyaad, Ahmad ibn Hanbal and others.” 4.This topic has been doing the rounds in the Ummah since the establishment of the Islamic State of Iraq. This summer,the opinion of Qaaidah al Jihad,holistically, regarding this topic was made clear by Shaykh Mustafa Abu al Yazid(HA) in his interview with Al jazeera. Here is an excerpt from the transcript,relevant to this topic : - “Al Jazeera interviewer : Let us talk about the subject of Iraq, and sheikh Usama spoke that the initiation to Palestine will be from Iraq, how can is [possible] to coordinate between two Amirs; Amir of Believers in Iraq and Amir of Believers in Afghanistan? And, how do you look at the behavior and practices of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) under the shadow of many Jihadist parties in Iraq, the country?” “Mustafa Abu al Yazid(ha) answers : Regarding Iraq, thanks to Allah, Jihad has achieved many of its intentions and this American enemy after six years decided to run and exit Iraq. And, regarding the subject of two Amirs in Afghanistan and Iraq: firstly, each Amir is in his [own] region, so it is spoken as this is an Amir of believers in Iraq and this one is in Afghanistan. The origin of this is to have for the Muslims one Amir; if there was an Islamic Caliphate and an Imamhood then the Muslim will have one Imam and one Caliph, but the Ulama spoke [out] about this matter and they showed that sometimes the Muslims face times where [people] thoughts become more distant and it becomes harder for the Muslims to have one Amir, so they allowed in these exceptional cases to have two Amirs for the Muslims. But, the obligation upon [all] Muslims to seek continuously to have one Amir, and this is the origin.” And Allah azza wa jall knows the best. Brother Greenbird ,please don't misunderstand me,and know that I love you for the sake of Allah. I only wanted to express what I have to say regarding this topic. May Allah azza wa jall keep us steadfast on Sirat al Mustaqim. Aameen. From your brother , Abu Sayyaf al Muhajir,also known as Bearer of the Sword. 30 September ,2009.

After he is tortured the first time, he says: Sir, I swear by Allah I am not related to the Taliban. After he says that, the leader of the army asks the soldiers to beat him. When the brother says, I swear by Allah... he is tortured for the second time. The pig leader then orders: 'Do not waste my time...' and threatens to cut the brother's body and destroy him. He is beaten for the third time. The pig curses him while the soldiers torture him... the brother is a bit steadfast this time and glorifies Allah. After that two other brothers are brutally beaten by the soldiers. One soldier is rebuked by the pig leader when he fails to stop beating the fourth brother. ""When I stay, stop, then stop! Give your attention to me, OK?"" The fourth brother is threatened by the pig to give 'correct answers instead of doing useless talk or....""

19482,41957,14036,Pakistans army beating Muslim Men..,75,Binyamine,"Peace,mercy and blessing of Allah be upon all of us. Quote: Video shows Pakistan army 'abuse' Pakistani soldiers are seen apparently abusing Taliban suspects in a 10-minute video which has been posted on the social networking site, Facebook. The video would be the first clear proof of such abuse. It shows men in military uniform beating suspects as officers stand by giving instructions. It is not clear who shot the film or where. It appears to have been made recently, perhaps in the Swat valley. Pakistan's army has said it needs to examine the video before commenting. Conversations heard on the video suggest it is recent. Troops recently declared they had largely cleared the Swat valley of insurgents after a sustained offensive there. Human rights groups have accused the military of being involved in torture and extra-judicial killings in the region. Whips ""This is a very serious accusation,"" Gen Athar Abbas, head of Pakistan army's public relations wing, told the BBC when asked about the video. ""I cannot comment on the video till we have examined it. This will take some time as the army headquarters will have to be involved in the process."" The footage shows an officer in Pakistani army battle uniform interrogating several suspects, some of whom are quite elderly and are presumably relatives of men being sought. When the officer does not receive satisfactory answers, he motions with his head and soldiers rush in to punish the suspect. They then beat him with belts, fists and what appear to be small whips. He is also kicked all over the body by soldiers wearing heavy army boots. The suspect is heard screaming and imploring the soldiers to stop in the name of Allah, repeatedly saying he has told them all he knows. In the video the soldiers administering the beating have to be restrained by the officer on at least two occasions. Threats After an initial round of punishment, the officer tells a suspect that this is ""soft treatment"". Unless the suspect tells all, the officer says he will have to administer ""hard punishment"". ""You don't want me to cut off your hands and feet,"" the officer says. If confirmed, this would be the first clear proof of the Pakistani army being involved in the abuse of detainees. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) and other groups have accused the army of such violations during the recent Swat campaign. The HRCP says it has also found evidence that the army is involved in extra-judicial killings in the region. The Pakistani army has consistently denied the reports, calling them ""baseless."" But it has also said it will investigate if any solid proof emerges of its personnel being involved in such activities.

Vancouver woman kidnapped in Pakistan pleads for life on video A Canadian woman being held hostage in northern Pakistan says her captors are planning to behead her at the end of the month if a $2-million ransom is not paid. In a video provided to the Globe and Mail and posted on the newspaper's website, a pale and haggard-looking Khadija Abdul Qahaar, 52, begins to cry as she says her ""time is very short and my life is going to end. ""I'm going to be killed, as you can see,"" Qahaar says on the video, pointing at a long knife hanging behind her. ""I'm going to be beheaded just like the Polish engineer, probably by the end of the month. The deadline is by the end of March."" Polish geologist Piotr Stanczak was beheaded by a Pakistani Taliban group on Feb. 7, 2009. In a shaky voice, Ms. Qahaar said she's being held by the Taliban ""someplace near the Afghan border in either Pakistan or Afghanistan. I'm not quite sure where I am."" ""A previous video has been made and distributed to my embassy, the Pakistan government, to various different NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and groups in order to try to get the demands that they're making met. ""Unfortunately nothing has happened."" The former West Vancouver resident was kidnapped in November along with three guides while travelling to record video. Ms. Qahaar, who changed her name from Beverly Giesbrecht after converting to Islam in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, is the owner and publisher of a controversial pro-Islamic web magazine called Jihad Unspun, which is registered to a West Vancouver address. Ms. Qahaar's website was criticized by the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies, which flagged it as ""a Canadian pro-terrorist website."" Lisa Monette, a spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs, told Canwest News Service Thursday night that officials were ""aware of this video, but we have no further comment."" Shortly after the tape was released, the Canadian Journalists for Free Expression said those holding Ms. Qahaar were demanding a ransom of $2 million. ""It is apparent that the kidnappers are increasing the pressure to get ransom money for her release,"" said group president Arnold Amber in a release. Ms. Qahaar had been visiting the tribal regions of Pakistan near the Afghan border, collecting material for a documentary for the Al-Jazeera network at the time of her kidnapping, the group said in a statement. The group said it's ""extremely concerned by the lack of progress in both this kidnapping case, and the Somali case in which Canadian journalist Amanda Lindhout and Australian journalist Nigel Brennan remain in captivity after almost seven months."" Jihad Unspun, which has been publishing Mideast news since 2002, posted a note on its website. ""With almost no resources, this tiny but remarkable woman raised the bar for courageous reporting,"" it says. ""She knew that her integrity would be attacked by both sides. ""Her primary goal is independent journalism that provides an alternate voice to Western media. She was aware of the risks involved in her latest journey, but had faith in those who were supposed to protect her."" Close Presented by",2009,03,20,2009-03-20 00:00:00.000,4208

If she is being held against her will, the Taliban Mujahideen typically have those demands, not $2 million, so perhaps she is being held by a warlord who just says he is Taliban in a effort to spook her, defame the Taliban, and get the cash money. If Khadija Abdul Qahaar was CIA, I highly doubt she would be ransomed for money. If, on the other hand, if the video is a hoax, I would assume it was done for the following reasons. 1) Khadija Abdul Qahaar is a CIA agent, and she has created this video to defame the Mujahideen. 2) Khadija Abdul Qahaar is in need on money, and created this video as an attempt to get it via either a gov't agency or donations. 3) Khadija Abdul Qahaar is an honest Muslimah and has worked with Mujahideen to create a fake video in order to help them get money, and she is not really in any danger. Either way, if there really is a deadline at the end of the month, time will tell.",2009,03,20,2009-03-20 00:00:00.000,4208

And this group already promised them of full support in case of operation. And after operation the man (Maulana Masood Azhar) weaps while the women are in the battle field. I ask members to do decide that issuing such statement is justice with those people being killed those mosques being destroyed. I myself had a Baytul Jihad on the hand of Maulana Masood Azhar and I have to admit that I learned about Jihad from Maulana Masood Azhar but when I came to know that Jihad is not only obligatory in Kashmir and Aghanistan but also in Pakistan, I asked a leader from Jaish my question that you people always complain that Pakistan is the front-line-state in War on ""terror"" and you send us to Kashmir and Afghanistan. In Afghanistan we were fighting against nothern allience who were also supporting kufr and your orders were to kill them but here in Pakistan we see the generals of Pakistan army are repeadtly saying with pride that they are front line in this war why not we start jihad here. That leader answered me that we have so far no fatwa of Ulama for Jihad in Pakistan and when the scholars the highest number of mujahideen in this war. Who say it has bombed the Bajaur Madarasa and etc. I found an answer to my question so I discussed it with Maulana Asmatullah Moawya and he told me that now we have got a fatwa and inshallah if the government did any action against Lal Masjid we will start armed Jihad against this government. I was very happy with his promise as I always love to be under the banner of a Jamat in such wars. After that fatwa from Maulana Abdul Aziz, government pressure started to mount on Lal Masjid and we started to visit the masjid to stay there to resist any government action against Lal Masjid. Similarly Maulana Masood Azhar also promised of Jihad against government in case of action on Lal Masjid (In his columns published in Al-qalam) so I was statisfied for a few months. But when the bloody operation silence started we asked our regional amir what will be our duty now. He told us that Maunala Masood Azhar has been weaping since start of operation and his not given any orders so far. And if he gives us order of Jihad then we will start Jihad and if he gave order of silence we will be silent. I was very disappointed with this and I thought that women are fighting in battle field while we the man will be weaping so I told the amir that what is the difference between us and Christians who had made their scholars and saints their lords instead of Allah. So I left Jaish and searched for a righteous Jamat and Al-hamdullilah I am statisfied now that I support a Jamat now which is free from government foriegn policy in its Jihad. Now I am in a Jamat which fights all the tawagheet it faces and this is what I wanted. This is my own story. Now I come to the bad things in noticed in Jaish. First: They still consider the security forces of Pakistan as muslims. Ask any scholar in Jaish he will answer you. I myself have asked this question from Maulana Qari Muhammad Sadiq in Bahawalpur. So this is a matter of Aqeedah. If you don't reject Taghoot your Tawheed is incomplete so for what you fight? And Jihad is always for Tawheed not for interests for certain countries. Second: They consider the Jihad in Pakistan a war between muslims. They sometime accuse Taliban of Pakistan as agents of RAW. I have heard such allegation from Maulana Abdur Rauf (brother of Masood Azhar). Third: They still get their trainings, money from Pakistan's ISI which implies getting support from murtadeen. If you want evidence, visit Pakistan held Kashmir and told them that you want to go to Indian held Kashmir for Jihad and all the step you passed there, you will see the reality. I myself have seen all of this with my own eyes. I have even met Col. Butt (whether it is original name or not) not to mention small agents of ISI. Fourth: Their Jihad is under the foriegn policy of Pakistan. If Pakistan want to send mujahideen to Kashmir Jaish will send you there and if Pakistan want to stop it Jaish will stop it. Again I myself have seen this with my own eyes. And currently they are sending mujahideen to Afghanistan only when the government allowed them to do so. The were first silent for years about Afghanistan till 2006. Fifth: They tell lies to its members about Mullah Muhammad Omar (may Allah protect him) which can result in a big division among the Mujahideen. For example they say He has ordered us not to killed members of Afghan National Army as they are muslims. Similarly the Pakistani forces because they too are muslims. If someone to believe this then how Shaykh Usama frequently asks Pakistani Mujahideen to target Pakistani security forces.",2009,10,13,2009-10-13 00:00:00.000,43448

20459,43685,14479,'Punjab militants joining hands with Pakistani Taliban',172,RebelzGang,"brothers Ayubi and abu_yazid, i thank you guys for making your arguments and posts regarding this matter. i have always known that all the Kashmiri orgs have links to ISI, mainly due to their common enemy- India. Some orgs are working with them, and some are completely their drones. however, i have always known that JeM and possibly Lashkar-e-Taiba had little to do with ISI. however, brother abu yazid, reading your post, and acepting your claims to be true, as i do believe what you say. maybe my information was wrong, maybe they have dealings with ISI just like the others. but the Five Points you mentioned about their beliefs, is really a shame if it is true. and i dont want to have anything to do with anyone who might have these beliefs. however, what i realize most importantly is that i must look into this matter myself and confirm that they really claimed that, before passing any judgements whatsoever. i must see the proof. because i cannot judge them for myself just because another brother alleges certain kufr beliefs or policies of theirs. since we cannot verify what you have said. but thanks for providing your own insight into this. i will try to dig up further informations regarding these matters. brother Ayubi, you mentioned that LeT might be working for ISI, but not JeM. but i would like to point out that Al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah was captured in a safehouse that belonged to LeT (and now hes serving in Guantanamo). if LeT were really working for ISI, then why was Abu Zubaydah with them, or why was LeT providing him with shelter?? maybe its because LeT has connections with AQ, and maybe because Abu Zubayda was doing joint-training with them. otherwise, AQ does not work with groups that are on the misguided path or affiliated with the enemy. so this is also an important issue to be seen.

Quote: Our military, religious and political leaders say that Pakistan Taliban have gone astray, but Taliban insist that its not them, rather the accusers have gone astray. They ask... If jihad was obligatory against Soviet Union then why not against US? If jihad is obligatory against US ally Hamid Karzai then why not against US allies Pervez Musharraf or Asif Zardari? If Shariah can be implemented through the use of force in Afghanistan then why not in Pakistan? If the members of religious groups in Pakistan can forcefully stop the new year night or fine arts festivals in educational institutes, then why can't we stop the anti shariah activities, as per our understanding, in areas under our control? If Jamat Islami memebrs right under their party's own (provincial) government can break the sign boards in Peshawar city, disregarding the government and the police altogether, then why can't we (TTP) stop illegal activities, as per our understanding, in areas under our control? If for our (TTP) activities no unanimous fatwa by the Pakistani scholars is available, then was there any unanimous fatwa by scholars of Pakistan or the Islamic world with reagrd to the above-mentioned matters? If it is not prohibited to kill the so-called Muslims like Dr Najeeb Ullah, B'brak Carmel, Hamid Karzai, Farooq Abdullah, and the like, then how does it become prohibited to kill Pakistani leaders and their friends? If it was not wrong to kill the soldiers and policemen under Dr Najeeb and leaders and policemen in Kashmir, even though they were Muslims just offering services to earn living for their families/children, then how come it becomes wrong to kill the Pakistani soldiers and policemen? Weren't the soldiers and policemen under Karzai regime Muslims and Afghans? They were also offering services in the name of earning living for their children! Now if it was fair to fight against them then how come it becomes prohibited to fight against the protectors of Pakistani State and Government?

Especially posts by brother lalaje, abu_yazid and some others have often shown a very detailed picture of the state of affairs that in general are not so obvious to and understood by the general public (people like me!) But respected brothers, there is question that still bothers my mind... (advance apologies for any ignorant and unintelligent opinion/remarks!) Just recently, I received a message that said... ""4 different countries with different religions: INDIA . ISRAEL . RUSSIA . AMERICA... Have united to break our country Then why we URDU . SINDHI . BALOCHI . PATHAN . PUNJABI... Can't unite for the sake of our country Why are we dividing when our: RELIGION . ALLAH . PROPHET . QURAN . KAABA... ARE ONE AND THE SAME!"" I know the theme of this msg is 'nationalism' which is in itself wrong. And I simply replied to it saying: ""because our government in its effort to please those 4 countries is killing its own people so we cannot stop the reaction anyway!!!"" But respected brothers...Though I know there must be many ground realities that only people in the field realize and understand, whereas people just counting on media reports may not be able to imagine them even remotely, but I wonder (and this is what bothers my mind that) can't there be any better solution in the current circumstances??? Whether Taliban, mujahideen face any losses OR the the employees of govt/security forces... both ways it pleases the enemies of Islam and Muslimeen! Both ways such situations indirectly add strength to their agendas. I by no mean intend to question or prove that targeting security/government organizations/employees is right or wrong. I understand the very simple phenomena of action and reaction in the whole scenario and that since these forces (working as allies of mushrikeen) are hindering the core work of Mujahideen (i.e., battle against mushrikeen), therefore the mujahideen have no other choice than 'adquately' taking care of this front too... actively and aggressively.... but again we are suffering and the enemies of Islam are enjoying by these scenes, may Allah destroy them, ameen. I also do not think it to be just the duty of the mujahideen to think of the solution to this complex situation...First of all it should be the govt to take such decisions that should be in the best interest of its people. If the govt has serious ethical problems and double standards, then it should be the civil society and most importantly civilians and general public who should raise voice and use the force of public pressure to get the things straight.... but very unfortunately the public is either victim of vicious circle of artificial inflation, poverty and other social evils or too devoid of the realization of the necessity of taking any action under these circumstances...(well that needs time which majorities do not have, after all they are too occupied and busy in watching TV, indian movies and then accordingly improving the standards of their secular lifestyle!) The most wise of all the groups is the one that has knowledge of Quran and Sunnah - Shariah. And obviously they are mujahideen - wa lillahil hamd. So i just wonder cant they think of any solution that should not be pleasing to the kuffar in any way??? I understand that in certain situations the multifolds of constarints makes it almost impossible to arrive at an ideal solution, and one is normally forced to make some level of compromise somewhere... but still I thought to speak out my thinking loud and put this question! In fact the politicians and other decision-makers at the top levels who impose alligance with US etc on their country people actually deserve to be targeted and destroyed... that certainly won't please kuffar as this not only disturb the smooth flow of their hidden agendas but will also keep on adding burden to their 'recruitment process' for filling the resultant gaps (though I know that still it wont make much difference as many willing candidates would still be in the queue to serve those kuffar against fellow Muslims). Nevertheless, these kuffar and their allies are not infallible! ""But they plan, and Allah plans. And Allah is the best of planners."" [Al-Anfal 8:30] Respected brothers/sisters, NO offence meant... hope I could get some fair and rational answer that could solve this perplexity!

We all know that the top level decision-makers (pleased and proud to be allies of US) are not sincere with anyone except themsleves! When employees of any forces or civilians die as a result of any reaction by the mujahideen.... the decision-makers whose decisions are the root cause of spreading all the 'fasad' damn care.... rather it helps them to fulfil the kuffar agenda in multidimensional ways (making ppl to believe that Taliban are evil or backed by India etc etc...) as they (the corrupt decision makers/political and military leadership) are sincere neither with Islam/Muslimeen nor with their own country ppl... what can we expect from puppets who do not mind even handing over Muslim women to kuffar in exchange of few filthy dollars, who have trapped their country people in artificial inflation (those who escape blasts etc themselves opt for suicide due to difficulties and stress caused by severe economical degradation), who are involved in dirty politics to an absolutely unimaginable extent ...! The general public (as 'Lard' MACAULAY of British India foresaw and planned ""a class of persons, Indian in blood and color, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect) unfortunately is devoid of any correct understanding of the concepts of Islam like takfeer/its validity, wala wal baraa.... etc etc (thanks to the ulema-e-soo' as well for contributing in MASS misguidance and ignorance of the public!!!). For the general public the saying in one of Iqbal's famous poem applies 'hay jurme zaeefi ki saza marg e mufaajat' (The punishment of the 'crime of weakness' is sudden death!) Their (the ignorant masses) lack of knowledge about Islam in its true face brings them to a point where they simply fail to understand the dynamics going on.... or simply get misled by the govt/media propaganda that overshadows the realities and simply labels Taliban/mujahideen as either mere India-backed terrorists against pakistan or rigid islamists etc etc.... I hope you at least agree with these observations? Brothers, just to share some more observations...I have heard stories mentioned by insider/eye witnesses how some army personnel were shot by their own fellows for not agreeing to participate in the action against jamia hafsa (and were later reported in the media as been killed by jamia's students). I myself have lost an uncle (civilian) in a blast (some years back) who had least to do with any forces/govt... and a family with two handicap children who lost their father (a lower level/clerical staff in army) in an attack on that same day.... Brother I am not trying to sympathise with these victims, for me whether an 'innocent' gets targeted in swat/wazirastan or in any other part of the country/world.... its one and the same thing. What I am trying to convey is that these killings make little difference for the real decison makers sitting in luxuries of their homes and offices and obeying their worldy gods!!! Yes, if these decision-makers get targeted then that would make a real sense amd it would be a real favor for Islam and Muslimeen insha'Allah! I am not questioning the methodology of reaction undertaken by Taliban/mujahideen as they have their own strengths and limitations (even if you read my earlier post...I asked an 'innocent question': can there be any 'better' solution? And I call it an 'innocent question' because I do not imagine that the mujahideen leadership would have not thought about the pros and cons of all possibilities rigorously... despite this I have taken the liberty to ask my question, expecting answers that could remove my perplexity, and that of many others like me!). But just sharing my observation that most of the people who are vulnerable or are being deprived of their lives on both sides hardly recognize what is actually going on. Not everyone has access to sources of info like this forum (before which even I myslef had many misconceptions about this subject). Believe me, I am not in favor of the govt/army/US allies alhamdulillah (but I wish if the real elements of corruption face the music instead of their ignorant servants/staff/public... that would sound really ideal) and I am not against Taliban/mujahideen.... I just wish and pray that Allah eliminates the root cause of all the fasad (the dirty leadership) so that the sufferings of innocents on both sides come to an end, ameen... when two elephants fight, the underneath grass suffers badly anyway! (the general public on both sides is like the grass and the conspirator fox (US) and its company (other kuffar) are ejoying the scenes of destruction!) [Well, btw, if I, Taliban/mujahideen supporter, cease to post on this forum for a longer period of time... you can make a rough guess of the reason as my vicinity is also a sensitive high-target area .... anyway its just a light joke.... life and death is something pre-destined and a Muslim needs not to fear about it - w'Allahu Akbar!] There is a great 'simultaneous' need to get the msg thru the masses (DONT KNOW HOW!... as I think that the msgs conveyed by the top AQ/Taliban leadership hardly get through to the public who count on TV/radio/newspapers as the main sources of info... and one can imagine the ratio of internet users in countries like Pak/Afghanistan... insignificant when compared ti the population size!) Just like Behavior Change Communication (BCC) done by kuffar for their sinister plans (BCC means overwhelm the masses with any message that you want them to believe in and gradually they will get tuned to it!!!)... there should be some real strategic effort to get the true msg accross to masses of misled people. And I am calling it a 'SIMULATNEOUS' need, I am not saying that the victims of tyrrany should first educate the people and then take any necessary steps (this approach upheld by some proponants of peace is certainly weird... as if Allah forbid someone attacks my home, I wont wait and first educate them and enjoin good and forbid evil... rather the instant reaction would be whatever kind of defence/aggression possible!) Brothers please forgive me for my thinking or any inarticulate comment if it causes any discontent (I am sure that my observations would be merely 'wishful thinking' in your opinion that has little to do with ground realities!) I just close this question-answer session from my side with a sincere prayer that may Allah protect and strengthen the mujahideen wherever they may be and may He destroy the enemies of Islam and Muslimeen everywhere, ameen.

20929,44423,14733,Jundullah claims responsibility for terror attack,54,ANSAR 007,"Salaam Alaykom, Jundullah has accepted responsibility for the deadly attack that rocked a security gathering in southeast Iran, killing 29 people and wounding another 28. The Jundullah terror ring, which is led by Abdolmalik Rigi, has claimed responsibility for the attack that targeted a unity gathering between Sunni and Shia tribal leaders in the borderline Pishin region, near the city of Sarbaz. Several top regional security officials such as provincial commanders of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) including Brigadier Nour-Ali Shoushtari and Brigadier Rajab-Ali Mohammadzadeh were also killed in the explosion. The explosion, which occurred at 08:00 local time (4:30), also claimed the lives of a group of tribal leaders and well known local figures of both the Shia and Sunni communities. The IRGC has condemned the attack as a gross act if “global arrogance” and a “horrific crime against humanity, carried out as revenge against the people who were working together to ensure the security of the region.” Jundullah is a Pakistan-based terrorist group closely affiliated with the notorious al-Qaeda organization. The terror ring has carried out countless bombings and other violent attacks in Iran. Some of the attacks for which it has claimed responsibility are the killings of at least 16 Iranian police officers in a 2008 attack, nine Iranian security guards in 2005, and another 11 in a 2007 bombing. A 2007 Sunday Telegraph report revealed that the CIA created Jundullah to achieve 'regime change in Iran', and said the US intelligence agency was trying to destabilize Iran by 'supplying arms-length support' and 'money and weapons' to the group. Another report posted by ABC also revealed that the US officials had ordered Jundullah to 'stage deadly guerrilla raids inside the Islamic Republic, kidnap Iranian officials and execute them on camera', all as part of a 'programmatic objective to overthrow the Iranian government'. In a recent interview with Press TV, Rigi's brother Abdulhamid also confirmed that the Jundullah leader had established links with the US agents. His brother said that in just one of his meetings with the US operatives, Rigi had received $100,000 to fuel sectarianism in Iran. MJ/DT",2009,10,18,2009-10-18 00:00:00.000,44423

These read the Qur'an everyday, they pray 5 times a day, they fast, they go to Hajj, the only difference is their love for Ahlul Bayt. If you really understand the Qur'an, you will find their love for Ahlul Bayt understable."" (excuse me if I translated anything incorrectly) Wa alaikum assalaam, I understand, akhi, but they have crossed the limits. Their religion curses the Sahaba (may Allah be pleased with them), and they have many deviant beliefs and practices. They have taken 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) as a demigod. They say our Qur'an is a fake and that their twelfth imam, who they say controls all the affairs of the world from his hiding place, is keeping the real Qur'an with him. They practice mut'ah marriages, and I could make a long list. Unless they abandon all this bid'ah and madness, no matter what they do, they are our enemies. Because if we join with them and are victorious, they will turn on us. Then, they will spread their deviant religion and confuse our future generations. It is better to keep them separate and not allow confusion. The war we are fighting is not just against the West. It is against all the enemies of Islam, in whatever form they come, and no matter what they call themselves or whatever disguises they wear. The Shi'a are the most treacherous, because of all the things you have said. They appear as any other Muslim on the outside, but when you see their true aqeedah, you realize they are not of us. Purifying our religion is a must. Allah, subhana wa ta'ala, will not grant us victory if our deen is not pure. The reason the Uthmani Khilafah is no longer with us is because they lost sight of their deen. We need to ally with those of sound aqeedah, even if we are only two and the entire earth is against us. That is how we will find success, insha'Allah.",2009,10,19,2009-10-19 00:00:00.000,44423

I do not want to start any unnecessary personal debate but I like to reply briefly so you would have some idea about my posts. I am new here and honestly it is my first interaction with mujahideen on a forum but I was always very close to the cause. I do not want to get into details. I just give my honest opinion without getting into politically correctness. I beg to differ with you about me as judgmental. You are not judgmental when you are talking about events or ideology. It is wrong only when you become judgmental about the ""niyyat"" and motives of others. Otherwise it is perspective, that could be different for different people. There is no harm in it as long as there is no compulsion. secondly, any statement with""if"" is a conditional statement not a judgment or accusation.

If I find a better and more credible source about some person or event, I do tend to change my opinion and stance. That's how I learned most of my life and still I do not see any problem with this. Yes, I do have tendency to give my opinions. I thing it is Sunnah and if I am not forcing any body to accept it, it is alright. I am not sure that if it is against the policies of this forum either. Lastly, brother, when ever you feel very strongly about any cause, you do develop some ideas and opinions. They may or may not be the best one but at least do not discourage me.

A group of heavily-armed Shebab fighters raided the graveyard where Sheikh Ali Ibar, a respected Sufi cleric who died before the 1991 collapse of the central government, was buried and smashed his mausoleum with sledgehammers. ""Using sledgehammers and hoes, the Shebab militiamen destroyed the grave of Sheikh Ali. We tried to stop them, in vain. They fired shots in the air to disperse the crowd,"" local elder Moalim Abdullahi Alim told AFP by phone. ""They destroyed everything of the little mausoleum and also ordered some Sufi scholars from the nearby mosque to leave,"" said Abdi Mukhtar, a resident who witnessed the scene. The Shebab, who have controlled much of central and southern Somalia since the middle of last year, have already desecrated several holy Sufi sites. ""The purpose for destroying those graves is to prevent people from overstepping the red line in their respect for the dead, which risks becoming actual worship of the dead,"" said Sheikh Ibrahim Hassan, a local Shebab leader. Sufism is dominant in clanic Somalia, where Muslim saints are often also clan founders, but its leading clerics have voiced concern that hardline Islamist groups such as the Shebab were slowly eradicating it. It emphasises the mystical dimension of Islam and includes practices considered as idolatry and innovations in the conservative Wahhabi sect adopted by the Shebab, which recently declared its allegiance to Al Qaeda.",2009,10,19,2009-10-19 00:00:00.000,3545

(even though Zbu Zubaydah was himself captured after 9/11). or wether LeT has been accused by Al Qaeda of ratting him out. while i respect everyones say, and i mean no disrespect (so i expect the same in return from everyone). but when their isnt much factual evidence or backing in a case as serious as this (nifaq and betrayel) against JeM or LeT, where we dont KNOW their crimes (unlike the case of Hamas) but we are UNSURE of them, then we must acquire or present some solid proofs. im sorry, that i have not been convinced of your claims (as i do not move easily to people's own mere allegements). i mean, if i am not convinced how can i go out and convince others. that, if i havent seen the evidences myself, then when ill go out and tell 10 other people, i will not be able to convince even one of them (as ill be unable to provide evidences). im not under anyone's payroll, and ive always distanced myself from organizations whom i Know work with kaffirs, but i cannot make any declaration of orgs of whom people as a whole are Unsure of. so if i were to believe everything that they are being accused of, then please do show me the evidences so that i may show 10 others the evidences, and they will inturn show a 100 others, and the truth shall surely spread.

Therefore I won't go reiterating everything I posted before. wassalaam Peace mercy and blessing of Allah be upon all of us. Dear brother in Islam, Abd Al Jabbar, Jazakallah Khairan for your advice. I do not know them so much as much as you know. But i just want to contribute on that forum by uploading their video which is islamically okay on blip.tv As for the beheading, i accept their excuse which is that children do visit that site. And it would be a bit difficult for the children to watch beheading. First beheading i saw was when a taliban decapitate a Russian Soldier when i was 14. The first time it was tough but i saw it again and i kinda appreciated it. I do not know any of their weird belief But what we can do or at least try is to teach them. Unfortunately i am not as knowledgable as you and brother Tarbiya. And i do not need people to appreciate my work. If the work is okay and beneficial to other muslim. then inshaAllah, my Lord, Allah will reward me, if not in this world , then in the Hereafter.

Usman: Assess the arrests throughout the world, and you will see that the largest number of Mujahideen have been arrested from Pakistan. The most arrests and murders of Mujahideen: where have they occurred? They have occurred in your Pakistan. So for God’s sake, Jihad is not a name for a struggle carried out under the influence of an intelligence agency. Jihad is what is carried out only and truly for the sake of the religion of Allah. Whatever hardship comes along the way for the sake of this religion, whether in the form of these Pakistani intelligence agencies or otherwise, we must fight firmly. It isn’t right that we be fighting in Kashmir in collaboration with these agencies. No! These are the hypocrites; these are the true hypocrites, clad in army uniforms. Come and see what a massive operation they are carrying out here in Waziristan. And we still call them Muslims?! How can they be Muslims?! Whom are they fighting? They are fighting the Mujahideen! Interview of Mullah Nazir with Alsahab.......About kashmir jihad As-Sahab: The religious class in Pakistan has been associated with the Jihad in Kashmir since many decades. What is your opinion about the Jihad in Kashmir and the role of the government and the ISI in it? Mulla Nazir: The Jihad in Kashmir and those who have offered sacrifices in it have done it with sincerity. But we believe that we are not achieving the objectives for which we lay down our lives. This is an affair running under the ISI and it is ludicrous to hope that the Shariah or Islam shall come this way. Thus the Jihad through which the ISI has put people into deception can bear no fruit. Our advice to those of our brothers is that they should support us here and join forces with us. We offer sacrifices to establish the Shariah and the law of Allah. The Kashmiri Jihad does not help us forward in achieving our objectives. There is a law of kufr in India and a law given by the British in Pakistan. One of these two brands of kufr shall prevail in Kashmir. It isn’t Islam that would reign…and so our sacrifices will go in vain. Therefore, we advise those Mujahideen to come together with us and work under the Emir of the Believers. Let your direction veer towards the Americans for now and your Jihad be in keeping with the Emir’s commands. Your sacrifices shall bear fruit; the Shariah shall be established and Allah’s land shall witness Allah’s law upon it. It is our sincere advice to those of our Mujahid brothers that they should renounce servitude to the ISI. A Message to the People of Pakistan Sheikh Mustafa Abul-Yazid Here I wish to ask the Jihadi and non-Jihadi Islamic organizations which have accepted life under the disgrace of the Pakistani government and protection, some of which even acknowledge its legitimacy instead of standing against it and opposing its oppression, even if it be in order not to be labeled as terrorists and supporting Al-Qaeda and Taliban: Have their stances brought them any benefit, or has the puppet regime of Pakistan which obeys the commands of its American masters started to chase after them and freeze their activities, imprisoning them? Is this not in total agreement of the saying of Allah, the Truth “The Jews and the Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their religion.” (Al-Baqarah: 220] Has Jihad in Afghanistan and Pakistan not become an individual obligation (fard ayn) as it has in Kashmir? [If not,] then why are we refraining from coming to the aid of our weak and oppressed Muslim brethren? O my Muslim brothers, both those in Islamic organizations in Pakistan or otherwise! Join the caravan of the blessed Jihad, that which is free of the restrictions of the war criminals of the Christian crusades and its puppet agents – the tyrannical idolic rulers. O Muslims of Pakistan! Indeed those who have betrayed you, proved treacherous and have destroyed Pakistan are the traitorous government of Pakistan and its murderous Muslim killing army. http://ansarnet.info/showthread.php?...=lashker+taiba",2009,10,27,2009-10-27 00:00:00.000,43448

Ahmed Mohamed Dhore celebrated his marriage to Safiya Abdulle late Tuesday in central Somalia before hundreds of guests. Somali adolescent girls are often married off to older men. But it is rare for a man as old as Dhore to marry a girl of Abdulle's age. Dhore says he wanted to marry Abdulle for a long time but waited for her to grow up. He says his children and two other wives agreed to the marriage, as did Abdulle's parents. Dhore claims to be more than 100, but there is no way to verify the claim. This marriage was his 6th; three of Dhore's wives have died. Polygamy is widely practiced in predominantly Muslim Somalia.",2009,10,28,2009-10-28 00:00:00.000,46536

22322,46650,15343,Feds: Leader of radical Islam group killed in raid,10,Asadullah Alshishani,"Detroit mosque leader killed in FBI raids Paul Egan / The Detroit News Detroit -- The leader of a Detroit mosque was shot and killed Wednesday during a series of FBI raids that resulted in charges against 12 and the death of an FBI dog. At least six of those charged -- who face conspiracy, weapons, and stolen goods charges but not terrorism charges -- were in federal custody late Wednesday afternoon. The case involves the Joint Terrorism Task Force and prosecutors from the national security unit of the U.S. Attorney's Office. Advertisement A complaint filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Detroit names Luqman Ameen Abdullah, imam of the Masjid Al-Haqq mosque in Detroit, as ""a highly placed leader of a nationwide radical fundamentalist Sunni group."" He was killed in a gun battle during one of the raids, according to a joint statement by federal officials. Abdullah, 53, also known as Christopher Thomas, was the local leader of a black Muslim group that calls itself ""Ummah,"" or the brotherhood, and wants to establish a separate state within the United States governed by Sharia law, Interim U.S. Attorney Terrence Berg and Andrew Arena, FBI special agent in charge in Detroit, said in a joint statement. The Ummah is headed nationally by Abdullah Al-Amin, formerly known as H. Rap Brown, who is serving a state sentence for the murder of two police officers in Georgia. A 45-page complaint alleged that Luqman Ameen Abdullah ""calls his followers to an offensive jihad,"" ""regularly preaches anti-government and anti-law enforcement rhetoric"" and preaches that every Muslim should ""have a weapon and should not be scared to use their weapon when needed."" The complaint further alleged that an armed group known as the ""Sutra team"" protected the mosque. In January, when members were evicted from a building on Joy Road for non-payment of property taxes, Detroit police confiscated two firearms, about 40 knives and martial arts weapons from Abdullah's apartment, the complaint alleged. The mosque then relocated to Clairmount in Detroit, the complaint says. Abdullah was to be arrested on a complaint that included charges of conspiracy to commit federal crimes, sale or receipt of stolen goods, providing firearms to a convicted felon, being a felon in possession of body armor, and altering or removing vehicle identification numbers. According to the complaint, Abdullah told an informant that if the FBI came to get him: ""I'll just strap a bomb on and blow up everybody."" On another occasion, he said: ""We've got to take out the U.S. government,"" the complaint alleges. The others charged are: • Mohammad Abdul Salaam, also known as Gregory Stone, 45, of Detroit with conspiracy to commit federal crimes and sale or receipt of stolen goods. • Abdullah Beard, also known as Detric Lamont Driver, 37, of Detroit with conspiracy to commit federal crimes. • Abdul Saboor, also known as Dwayne Edward Davis, 37, of Detroit with conspiracy to commit federal crimes. • Mujahid Carswell, also known as Mujahid Abdullah, 30, of Detroit and Ontario, Canada, with conspiracy to commit federal crimes. • Adam Ibraheem, 38, of Detroit with conspiracy to commit federal crimes. • Gary Laverne Porter, 59, of Detroit with conspiracy to commit federal crimes and possession of firearms by a convicted felon. • Ali Abdul Raqib, 57, of Detroit with conspiracy to commit federal crimes. • Mohammad Alsahi, also known as Mohammad Palestine, 33, of Ontario, Canada, with conspiracy to commit federal crimes. • Yassir Ali Khan, 30, of Ontario, Canada, and Warren, with conspiracy to commit federal crimes. • Mohammad Abdul Bassir, also known as Franklin D. Roosevelt Williams, 50, of Ojibway Correctional Facility with conspiracy to commit federal crimes, sale or receipt of stolen goods, mail fraud, supplying firearms to felons, possession of weapons by a felon, and altering or removing motor vehicle identification numbers. One more man, A.C. Pusha, was charged in a separate complaint late Wednesday and charged with conspiracy to commit federal crimes. Salaam, Saboor, Porter, Beard, Ibraheem, Raqib, and Pusha all appeared in U.S. District Court in Detroit late Wednesday afternoon and were held pending detention hearings Thursday. Others charged are still at large. The operation involved locations in Detroit and Dearborn. Yellow police tape was put up outside a trucking and warehouse firm on Miller Road just north of Michigan Avenue, and a Dearborn police car was parked outside. Another site involved in the raids was on Tireman near Interstate 96 on the city's west side. A third site raided by the FBI was on Genesee in Detroit. pegan@detnews.com (313) 222-2069 David Josar, Charlie LeDuff, Oralandar Brand-Williams and George Hunter contributed.",2009,10,28,2009-10-28 00:00:00.000,46641

22400,46771,15343,Feds: Leader of radical Islam group killed in raid,10,Asadullah Alshishani,"After a 2-year investigation, FBI agents descended on a Dearborn warehouse Wednesday hoping to capture the suspected head of an Islamic fundamentalist group. The scene quickly turned chaotic, however, in a shootout that caused agents to gun down Luqman Ameen Abdullah, 53, leader of the Masjid Al-Haqq mosque in Detroit. Abdullah is accused in a federal complaint of heading a Sunni Muslim group with the mission of establishing a separate Islamic nation within the United States. Eleven other men were criminally charged in the raids, which also occurred in Detroit. Abdullah, known to some as Christopher Thomas, died after firing on officers during the raid, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. An FBI dog also was fatally wounded. The suspects ""are members of a group that is alleged to have engaged in violent activity over a period of many years and known to be armed,"" a joint statement from the Detroit FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office said. Abdullah and the others were charged with conspiracy to commit several federal felonies, including illegal possession and sale of firearms and theft from interstate shipments. Three of the men charged were at large Wednesday night. The others are expected to appear in U.S. District Court in Detroit today for detention hearings. Abdullah spoke of attacking Super Bowl XL Abdullah believed he and his followers were soldiers at war against the government and non-Muslims. ""Abdullah told his followers it is their duty to oppose the FBI and the government and it does not matter if they die,"" FBI agent Gary Leone said in an affidavit unsealed Wednesday. ""He also told the group that they need to plan to do something."" Abdullah, 53, of Detroit stayed true to his word Wednesday as armed FBI agents raided a Dearborn warehouse at Michigan Avenue and Miller. Four other suspects surrendered without incident. Authorities said Abdullah refused to surrender, opened fire and then died in a shootout in which an FBI dog also was killed. ""We're not any fake terrorists, we're the real terrorists,"" Abdullah once boasted to an undercover informant, according to the affidavit. (2 of 5) Agents also raided two Detroit homes, one in the 4400 block of Tireman and the other in the 9200 block of Genessee. The affidavits and returns for those warrants were sealed Wednesday. The U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI in Detroit unsealed a 43-page document, however, describing a sinister, radical fundamentalist group allegedly headed by Abdullah. The document notes conversations he had with undercover agents and federal informants that ranged from talking about attacking Super Bowl XL in Detroit to blowing himself up as a final act of courage. ""If they are coming to get to me, I'll just strap a bomb on and blow up everybody,"" he said in a March 21, 2008, conversation. Federal officials said Abdullah was the leader of a group that calls itself ""Ummah, a group of mostly African-American converts to Islam, which seeks to establish a separate Sharia-law governed state within the United States."" ""The Ummah is ruled by Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, formerly known as H. Rap Brown, who is serving a state sentence ... for the murder of two police officers in Georgia."" Brown came to prominence in the 1960s as a leader of the Black Panther Party. Referring to Abdullah, Leone said in the affidavit, ""He regularly preaches antigovernment and antilaw enforcement rhetoric. Abdullah and his followers have trained regularly in the use of firearms and continue to train in martial arts and sword fighting."" Why Abdullah and his followers chose Detroit as their haven remains unknown, Detroit FBI spokeswoman Sandra Berchtold said Wednesday. According to the affidavit, Abdullah ran a mosque in a building on Joy Road in Detroit until he was evicted in January for delinquent taxes, causing a move to the 4000 block of Clairmount. Inside the mosque, authorities said, Abdullah conducted firearms training, spewed hate and sometimes violently disciplined children by beating them with sticks. He beat one boy ""so badly with sticks that he was unable to walk for several days,"" Leone said in his affidavit. (3 of 5) During the Jan. 20 eviction, police found two firearms and about 40 knives and martial arts weapons in Abdullah's apartment within the mosque, investigators said. Authorities said none of the charges levied Wednesday are terrorist-related, but U.S. Attorney Terrence Berg said the case is still under investigation. Abdullah and 11 suspects were charged with felonies including illegal possession and sale of firearms, mail fraud to obtain the proceeds of arson, theft from interstate shipments and tampering with motor vehicle identification numbers. Seven of the suspects were in U.S. District Court on Wednesday for initial appearances, one was in custody and three were still being sought. Even as FBI investigators kept tabs on Abdullah through surveillance, he urged his cohorts to learn of the agents' whereabouts. ""Trail them, follow them, know where they house is at, and everything else,"" he told an informant, according to the criminal complaint. ""You've got hundreds of agents right there off Michigan"" Avenue. The reference was to the McNamara Building, the headquarters of the Detroit FBI. ""The FBI knows that I will kill them,"" he said, adding that police also are targets, according to the affidavit. Imad Hamad, senior national adviser and regional director of the Dearborn-based Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, said he received a call from the head of the FBI's Detroit office midday to tell him about the raid. Hamad said FBI Special Agent Andrew Arena told him that the case was ""solely criminal"" and had to do with ""smuggling and fraud."" He said Arena revealed few details of the investigation, but said it had been ongoing for about two years. Hamad said he didn't know the defendants. ""Agents were trying to chase some people,"" Hamad said Arena told him, referring to the raid. ""They were giving instructions to lay down. He resisted. He pulled a gun. They exchanged fire, he was shot down, killed. A dog ... was dead as well."" (4 of 5) The warehouse is near the heavily commercial intersection of Miller and Michigan. Dawud Walid, head of the Michigan Council on American-Islamic Relations, said Arena called him as well. Walid said he knew Abdullah. ""I know him as a respected imam in the Muslim community,"" Walid said. Shadi Saad, the owner of Wellcare Pharmacy on Oakman in Dearborn, said he stepped outside before lunchtime to see several people in FBI jackets with guns going toward the warehouse across the street. He heard noises like shots and a short time later a helicopter descended. ""It was like a movie scene for a minute,"" Saad said. He said he opened his business just 10 days ago. ""This isn't the way I wanted it to start."" Contact BEN SCHMITT: 313-223-4296 or bcschmitt@freepress.com. Staff writers Bill Laitner, Zlati Meyer and Amber Hunt contributed to this report.

22485,46912,15343,Feds: Leader of radical Islam group killed in raid,10,Asadullah Alshishani,"DETROIT – The FBI is trying to determine whether members of a radical Detroit-area Islamic group were homegrown jihadists or merely a ""bunch of thugs with bluster,"" a congressman said Thursday. One thing is certain: They are not mainstream Muslims, the agency said. Luqman Ameen Abdullah skimmed 20 percent of the profit off the furs, electronics and other items his followers fenced, and he preached that it was OK for them to steal as long as they prayed, FBI agent Gary Leone wrote in an affidavit filed with a criminal complaint against 11 group members. Abdullah, 53, was killed Wednesday in a shootout with agents after the FBI raided a suburban warehouse the group used. Eight members, including Abdullah's son, have been arrested and authorities were seeking the public's help in capturing the other two. The group members are charged with various federal crimes, chiefly conspiracy to sell stolen goods. The FBI says Abdullah, also known as Christopher Thomas, was an imam, or prayer leader, of a local faction of Ummah, a group that seeks to establish an Islamic state within the U.S. Authorities say Abdullah preached hate for the government and encouraged his followers to commit violence, especially against police and federal agents. According to the affidavit, Abdullah told a confidential FBI source that if the government messed with him, ""it will be straight up war."" Andrew Arena, the head of the FBI's Detroit office, stressed Thursday that Abdullah's mosque, Masjid Al-Haqq, was in no way representative of the Detroit area's large Muslim community. ""This is a very hybrid radical ideology. I don't know that I'd call it a religion,"" Arena said. Among Arab-Americans, there's a fear ""this is going to be portrayed as another al-Qaida sleeper cell in the United States and this is going to bring unwanted attention. ... That's certainly not the way we feel,"" Arena said. The government has not charged Abdullah's followers with terrorism-related charges, and Arena and U.S. Attorney Terrence Berg declined to comment about whether they planned to do so. A criminal complaint is a temporary charge that typically is followed by an indictment. Berg said Abdullah's group's anti-government beliefs motivated them to commit crimes, but he declined to elaborate. Rep. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said he talked to FBI Director Robert Mueller and was told the agency was trying to determine if the men were a ""bunch of thugs with bluster"" or possible homegrown jihadists. Ummah is a movement with no apparent central religious authority, so it's difficult to say what the group's factions teach in their mosques. In Warren, a Detroit suburb, local imams met privately with Arena and Berg to discuss the arrests. They were joined by Imam Mutawaf Shaheed of Cleveland, who identified himself as a representative of Ummah. He said the mission is to ""spread charity, good faith and understanding about Islam"" — not overthrow the government. The FBI said at least five of the 11 people charged by the government have felony convictions, including Abdullah, who was convicted of assault and carrying a concealed weapon in Detroit in 1981. Gary Porter, 59, was arrested Wednesday at A.L. Holmes Elementary School in Detroit, where he teaches gym. He's charged with conspiracy and being an ex-convict in possession of guns or ammunition. Two suspects were still at large: Yassir Ali Khan, 30, of Warren and Ontario, and Mohammad Philistine, 33, of Ontario. Abdullah's mosque is at a two-family flat next to a boarded-up house in Detroit. His group was evicted from another location this year because of nonpayment of property taxes. Jamil Ibm Rafael, 60, identified himself as the mosque's lone security officer. He said the FBI's portrayal of Abdullah was ""fabricated,"" but he acknowledged that members often speak out against the government. ""They are making up stuff. It's a war against Islam,"" Rafael said of authorities. Arena said a search of a Detroit duplex where Abdullah lived turned up weapons, including an M-16 assault rifle. ""The person I knew and the person who lives here is not the person ... that is on TV with all the allegations,"" said Joseph Taylor, 44, who lived above Abdullah for about 10 years. The FBI penetrated his group with the help of confidential informants who recorded conversations with Abdullah. A year ago, the FBI hatched an undercover operation in which Abdullah and others believed they were selling stolen goods worth more than $5,000. The FBI said Abdullah received at least 20 percent, telling allies that it's the way ""dirty money is purified."" ___ Associated Press writers David Runk, Corey Williams and Jeff Karoub contributed to this story.",2009,10,30,2009-10-30 00:00:00.000,46641

Ms. Giesbrecht did not respond to questions, but repeatedly pleaded for help and said her health is deteriorating because of the conditions in which she is being held. Her voice was extremely weak. “This is Beverly Giesbrecht, in Taliban captivity,” she said to introduce herself. “I don't know where I am. Somewhere on the Pak-Afghan border. Please, please help me out from here. … Please, please accept their demands. I have very few days to be killed.” The line was cut abruptly, one minute and 25 seconds after the call began. Ms. Giesbrecht, a West Vancouver publisher of a pro-Islamic website, went to Pakistan last summer to do research as a freelance journalist. In a video message previously released by her captors, she said she had returned to the Bannu region of Pakistan, to pick up some antique coins from a local man she knew, who wanted them sold in England. She, along with a translator and another assistant, were kidnapped in November by gunmen who reportedly work for a Taliban commander, Gul Bahadur. He leads fighters in Pakistan's volatile North Waziristan agency along the Afghan border. Two videos released by the kidnappers earlier in her ordeal have shown Ms. Giesbrecht, a Muslim convert also known as Khadija Abdul Qahaar, pleading for authorities to pay a ransom. In one recording she said the Taliban threatened to behead her if they do not receive $375, 000 (U.S.) by March 31. In her brief call Monday, Ms. Giesbrecht again urged Canadian authorities to pay the ransom. “I will be grateful if they accept what they [Taliban] demand,” she said. “I have very few days before my life is going to end.” Glen Cooper, a long-time friend of Ms. Giesbrecht in Canada, said he did not doubt the authenticity of the phone call. But he declined further comment. In one of her earlier videos, Ms. Giesbrecht had complained about her failing health. “I am very sick,” she said, looking pale and exhausted, her head wrapped in a scarf. “I need a hospital right away. I'm missing teeth. I have pneumonia and I need this to happen quickly. The Taliban are making demands and I need the Canadian embassy and the Pakistan embassy and every other human-rights organization to contact the Taliban as soon as possible because I'm going to lose my life.” A source in the Taliban-controlled area in which she was kidnapped said in an interview that Ms. Giesbrecht had fallen ill from unfiltered drinking water, but that she had received medical treatment. He said that because of her poor health her captors are urgently trying to secure a ransom payment and release her. “Because of her rapidly deteriorating condition, she fell unconscious for several hours some weeks back, and then she was provided with medical treatment,” he said by phone. “There is no special food or filtered water for her here but medical facilities can be provided when need be.” Officials with Foreign Affairs Canada have routinely declined comment on Ms. Giesbrecht's situation, except to say her release is being sought through appropriate channels.

But sadly this is the cultural issues which might arise and in some cases you maybe dont want to do something which no one else does? For example Allah (swt) says in the Qur´an Surah 2:234 If any of you die and leave widows behind; they shall wait concerning themselves four months and ten days when they have fulfilled their term, there is no blame on you if they dispose of themselves in a just and reasonable manner. And Allah is well acquainted with what ye do. (234) Sayyid Qutb (May Allah have mercy on him) says in his commentary to this verse Quote: In pre-Islamic Arabia, widows suffered a great deal of injustice at the hands of their own families, their in-laws and society in general. When a husband died, his widow would be confined to a drab part of the home and made to wear her shabbiest clothes and refrain from using any perfume or incense for a whole year. At the end of that period, she would be required to perform a series of degrading and meaningless rituals which included casting animal faeces into the air and riding an ass or a sheep through the town or village. Islam did away with all those worthless customs and alleviated the suffering of widows who, in addition to the grief of losing their husbands, had to endure the humiliation and persecution of their families and were deprived of the opportunity to resume a happy and decent family life. Islam set a waiting period of four months and ten days, which is slightly longer than that for a divorced wife, unless a woman is pregnant, in which case her waiting period extends until she has delivered. The purpose of the waiting period is to determine whether the woman is pregnant and to avoid hurting the feelings of the family of her deceased husband by leaving his home immediately after his death. During this period, the widow wears modest clothes, and does not wear the sort of make-up that encourages suitors to propose marriage to her. Once the waiting period is over, no one, from either her family or that of her deceased husband, has the right to dictate to her what to do with her life. She is totally free to decide for herself within the established traditions and teachings of Islam. She is free to wear all the adornments permitted for Muslim women, to receive marriage proposals, and to give her consent to marrying anyone she chooses, unimpeded by any antiquated or unreasonable traditions or customs. She has only God to please and fear. For: “God is aware of all that you do.”",2009,11,02,2009-11-02 00:00:00.000,46536

An Army spokesman at the Pentagon says the shootings began about 1:30 p.m. Thursday at a personnel and medical processing center at Fort Hood. The spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Nathan Banks, says two shooters were apparently involved. There is no word yet on who they were, nor on identities of the dead. Banks says the second incident took place at a theater on the sprawling base. He says it is too soon to tell whether there is any link to battle stress or repeated deployments. The Army is suffering a record high suicide rate and other signs of stress from fighting two wars. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. FORT HOOD, Texas (AP) — The U.S. Army has closed its massive Army base at Fort Hood, Texas, amid reports that several people have been shot and killed at the post. The Web site of the base in central Texas has posted an alert that says, ""Effective immediately Fort Hood is closed."" The Web site said that units at the base have been ordered to account for all personnel. The site says, ""This is not a Drill. It is an Emergency Situation."" Several television stations in Texas say several people were both killed and wounded in the shooting. Officials at the base and in the nearby town of Killeen, Texas, have not confirmed those accounts. Fort Hood is located halfway between Austin and Waco.",2009,11,05,2009-11-05 00:00:00.000,48272

The gunman was a soldier, and two other soldiers have been detained as suspects, Army Lt. Gen. Bob Cone said. The slain gunman was Maj. Malik Nadal Hasan, according to a law enforcement source. The source believes he is 39 or 40 years old. Ten of the other dead also were soldiers, while the remaining one was a civilian police officer who was working as a contractor on the base, Cone said. Two of the injured were in ""very serious"" condition, Fort Hood spokesman Christopher Hogue said. More than one shooter may have been involved, Cone said. ""All the casualties took place at the initial incident, that took place at 13:30 [1:30 p.m. CT], at the soldier readiness facility,"" Cone said. The primary shooter had two weapons, both handguns, he said. ""The local police response forces were there relatively quickly and killed the confirmed shooter,"" Cone said. President Obama called the shootings ""tragic"" and ""a horrific outburst of violence."" He expressed his condolences for the shooting victims. ""These are men and women who have made the selfless and courageous decision to risk, and at times give, their lives to protect the rest of us on a daily basis,"" Obama said. ""It's difficult enough when we lose these brave Americans in battles overseas. It is horrifying that they should come under fire at an Army base on American soil."" Officials at Fort Hood, which is the Army's largest U.S. post, were asking people there to stay away from windows, CNN affiliate KXXV said. The incident took place at the sports dome, now known as the soldier readiness area, the station reported. A congressional aide said he was on the post to attend a graduation service when he saw a soldier with blood on his uniform near the building where the service was being held, the Austin American-Statesman reported. Greg Schannep, an aide to U.S. Rep. John Carter, said the soldier ran past him and said a man was shooting. He said the soldier appeared to be injured in a shoulder, the American-Statesman reported. FBI agents are headed to the scene to assist, said Erik Vasys, spokesman for the FBI office in San Antonio. He had no other details.

Rick Lynch, told CNN that he was trying to ease the kind of stresses soldiers face. He has pushed for soldiers working a day schedule to return home for dinner by 6 p.m., and required his personal authorization for anyone working weekends. At the time, two soldiers stationed there had committed suicide in 2009 -- a rate well below those of other posts. Nearby Killeen was the scene of one of the most deadly shootings in American history 18 years ago when George Hennard crashed his truck into a Luby's Cafeteria and began shooting, killing 23 people and wounding 20. Hennard's spree lasted 14 minutes. He eventually took his own life.",2009,11,06,2009-11-06 00:00:00.000,48272

23308,48384,15756,"13 dead, 30 wounded in dual attacks at Fort Hood, Texas",10,Asadullah Alshishani,"WASHINGTON – His name appears on radical Internet postings. A fellow officer says he fought his deployment to Iraq and argued with soldiers who supported U.S. wars. He required counseling as a medical student because of problems with patients. There are many unknowns about Nidal Malik Hasan, the man authorities say is responsible for the worst mass killing on a U.S. military base. Most of all, his motive. But details of his life and mindset, emerging from official sources and personal acquaintances, are troubling. For six years before reporting for duty at Fort Hood, Texas, in July, the 39-year-old Army major worked at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center pursuing his career in psychiatry, as an intern, a resident and, last year, a fellow in disaster and preventive psychiatry. He received his medical degree from the military's Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., in 2001. While an intern at Walter Reed, Hasan had some ""difficulties"" that required counseling and extra supervision, said Dr. Thomas Grieger, who was the training director at the time. Grieger said privacy laws prevented him from going into details but noted that the problems had to do with Hasan's interactions with patients. He recalled Hasan as a ""mostly very quiet"" person who never spoke ill of the military or his country. ""He swore an oath of loyalty to the military,"" Grieger said. ""I didn't hear anything contrary to those oaths."" But, more recently, federal agents grew suspicious. At least six months ago, Hasan came to the attention of law enforcement officials because of Internet postings about suicide bombings and other threats, including posts that equated suicide bombers to soldiers who throw themselves on a grenade to save the lives of their comrades. They had not determined for certain whether Hasan is the author of the posting, and a formal investigation had not been opened before the shooting, said law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the case. In an interview with The Washington Post, Hasan's aunt, Noel Hasan of Falls Church, Va., said he had been harassed about being a Muslim in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks and he wanted out of the Army. ""Some people can take it and some people cannot,"" she said. ""He had listened to all of that and he wanted out of the military."" She said he had sought a discharge from the military for several years, and even offered to repay the cost of his medical training. A spokesman for the Army, Lt. Col. George Wright, told the Post he could not confirm that Hasan had sought a discharge. Noel Hasan said her nephew ""did not make many friends"" and would say ""they military was his life."" A cousin, Nader Hasan, told The New York Times that after counseling soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with post-traumatic stress disorder, Hasan knew war firsthand. ""He was mortified by the idea of having to deploy,"" Nader Hasan said. ""He had people telling him on a daily basis the horrors they saw over there."" Federal law-enforcement agents ordered an evacuation of the apartment complex where Hasan lived in Killeen, Texas, Thursday night and conducted a search of his home, said Hilary Shine, director of public information for the city. She didn't say what was found during the search. Officials said earlier that federal search warrants were being drawn up to authorize the seizure of his computer. Retired Army Col. Terry Lee, who said he worked with Hasan, told Fox News that Hasan had hoped President Barack Obama would pull troops out of Afghanistan and Iraq. Lee said Hasan got into frequent arguments with others in the military who supported the wars, and had tried hard to prevent his pending deployment. Hasan attended prayers regularly when he lived outside Washington, often in his Army uniform, said Faizul Khan, a former imam at a mosque Hasan attended in Silver Spring, Md. He said Hasan was a lifelong Muslim. ""I got the impression that he was a committed soldier,"" Khan said. He spoke often with Hasan about Hasan's desire for a wife. On a form filled out by those seeking spouses through a program at the mosque, Hasan listed his birthplace as Arlington, Va., but his nationality as Palestinian, Khan said. ""I don't know why he listed Palestinian,"" Khan said, ""He was not born in Palestine."" Nothing stood out about Hasan as radical or extremist, Khan said. ""We hardly ever got to discussing politics,"" Khan said. ""Mostly we were discussing religious matters, nothing too controversial, nothing like an extremist."" Hasan earned his rank of major in April 2008, according to a July 2008 Army Times article. He served eight years as an enlisted soldier. He also served in the ROTC as an undergraduate at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. He received a bachelor's degree in biochemistry there in 1997. ___ Associated Press writers Lara Jakes, Pam Hess, Lolita C.

He inentionally took his life (suicide) for a noble cause i.e. saving the lives of his soldier. To say that this soldier committed suicide is inappropriate. Its more appropriate to say he is a brave hero that sacrificed his life for a more noble cause. Scholars have paralled this to suicide bombers whose intention, by sacrificing their lives, is to help save Muslims by killing enemy soldiers. If one suicide bomber can kill 100 enemy soldiers because they were caught off guard that would be considered a strategic victory. Their intention is not to die because of some despair. The same can be said for the Kamikazees in Japan. They died (via crashing their planes into ships) to kill the enemies for the homeland. You can call them crazy i you want but their act was not one of suicide that is despised by Islam.

The manager, John Thompson, says a fellow soldier allegedly keyed Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan's car and ripped up the bumper sticker. Thompson says the soldier had been to Iraq and was upset to learn Hasan was Muslim. Thompson, who manages the Killeen, Texas complex where Hasan lives, says the bumper sticker read: ""Allah is Love."" In Arabic, Allah means God. A report filed on Aug. 16 with Killeen police says Hasan's car had been scratched causing $1,000 worth of damage. The report says an Army employee had been arrested. It didn't provide more details about what happened. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. FORT HOOD, Texas (AP) — An Army psychiatrist suspected of opening fire on fellow soldiers at Fort Hood cleaned out his apartment in the days before the rampage that left 13 people dead, a neighbor said Friday. The neighbor, Patricia Villa, said Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan came over to her apartment Wednesday and Thursday and offered her some items, including a new Quran, saying he was going to be deployed on Friday. She wasn't sure if he was going to Iraq or Afghanistan. Authorities said the 39-year-old Hasan went on a shooting spree later Thursday at the sprawling Texas post. He was among 30 people wounded in the rampage and remained hospitalized Friday in a coma, attached to a ventilator. All but two of the injured were still hospitalized, and all were listed in stable condition. Investigators were trying to piece together how and why Hasan allegedly gunned down his comrades in one of the worst mass shootings ever on an American military base. His motive wasn't known, but some who knew Hasan said he may have been struggling with a pending deployment and faced pressure in his work with distressed soldiers. Hasan's family said in a statement Friday that his alleged actions were ""despicable and deplorable"" and don't reflect how the family was raised. President Barack Obama ordered the flags at the White House and other federal buildings be at half-staff and urged people not drawn conclusions while authorities investigate. ""We don't know all the answers yet. And I would caution against jumping to conclusions until we have all the facts,"" Obama said in a statement. The shooting spree began as some 300 soldiers had been lined up to get vaccinations and have their eyes tested at a Soldier Readiness Center, where soldiers who are about to be deployed or who are returning undergo medical screening. Nearby, others were lining up in commencement robes for a ceremony to celebrate troops and families who had recently earned degrees. Soldiers reported that the gunman shouted ""Allahu Akbar!"" — an Arabic phrase for ""God is great!"" — before opening fire, said Lt. Gen. Robert Cone, the base commander. He said officials had not yet confirmed that Hasan made the comment. When the gunfire subsided, soldiers described a scene that looked like a war zone: too many wounded to count, shells and blood on the floor, and comrades ripping off their clothes to make tourniquets to keep the injured alive. One woman, suffering from a wound to the hip, carried another victim to get help. ""You had people without tops on. You had people ripping their pant legs off,"" said Sgt. Andrew Hagerman, a military police officer from Lewisville, Texas. Hagerman arrived at the scene minutes after the shooting stopped. When he entered the building, he kept his head down to avoid stepping in the pools of blood or kicking any spent shell casings. ""You could go around it,"" he said. ""There was definitely a path."" The gunman was struck four times by a civilian police officer who also was wounded herself. Authorities said Kimberly Munley fired on the suspect just three minutes after the gunfire began, and base officials said her efforts ended the crisis. Munley was recovering Friday at a hospital and was in stable condition. ""It was an amazing and aggressive performance by this police officer,"" Cone said. Hagerman said he saw Hasan laying on the ground receiving medical assistance for a gunshot wound as responders tried to get his handcuffs off to better treat him. Hasan reported for duty at Fort Hood in July, after working at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington for six years. Though Hasan apparently had problems at Walter Reed, officials at the Fort Hood hospital said they weren't aware of any issues with his job performance. One of Hasan's bosses praised his work ethic and said he provided excellent care for his patients. ""Up to this point I would consider him an asset,"" said Col. Kimberly Kesling, deputy commander of clinical services at Darnall Army Medical Center. An imam from a mosque Hasan regularly attended said Hasan, a lifelong Muslim, was a committed soldier, gave no sign of extremist beliefs and regularly wore his uniform at prayers. Villa, who recently moved next door to Hasan, said she had never spoken to him before he came over to her apartment. She said Hasan gave her frozen broccoli, spinach, T-shirts and shelves on Wednesday, then returned Thursday morning and gave her his air mattress, several briefcases and a desk lamp. He then offered her $60 to clean his apartment Friday morning, after he was supposed to leave. Someone who used to work with Hasan said he had expressed some anger about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Retired Col. Terry Lee told Fox News said Hasan had hoped President Barack Obama would pull troops out of Afghanistan and Iraq and got into frequent arguments with others in the military who supported the wars. But another neighbor said Hasan appeared to be OK with his pending deployment, which he said was supposed to be to Afghanistan. ""I asked him how he felt about going over there, with their religion and everything, and he said, `It's going to be interesting,'"" said Edgar Booker, a 58-year-old retired soldier who now works in a cafeteria on the post. Col. Steve Braverman, the Fort Hood hospital commander, said early Friday that Hasan was on deployment orders to Afghanistan. A military official later told The Associated Press that Hasan was to be deployed to Iraq. It was not immediately possible to verify the discrepancy. The military official, who did not have authorization to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, said Hasan had indicated he didn't want to go to Iraq but was willing to serve in Afghanistan. Cone said authorities have not yet been able to talk to Hasan, but interviews with witnesses went through the night. Officials are not ruling out the possibility that some of the casualties may have been victims of ""friendly fire,"" that in the confusion at the shooting scene some of the responding military officials may have shot some of the victims. Cone acknowledged that it was ""counterintuitive"" that a single shooter could hit so many people, but he said the massacre occurred in ""close quarters. ""With ricochet fire, he was able to injure that number of people,"" Cone said. He said authorities were investigating whether Hasan's weapons were properly registered with the military. The wounded were dispersed among hospitals in central Texas, Cone said. Their identities and the identities of the dead were not immediately released. Friday was designated a day of mourning at Fort Hood. There also will be a ceremony at the air base to honor the dead. Hasan, who was born in Northern Virginia, pursued a career in psychiatry at Walter Reed, working as an intern, a resident and, last year, a fellow in disaster and preventive psychiatry. The Army major received his medical degree from the military's Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., in 2001. But his record at Walter Reed wasn't sterling. He received a poor performance evaluation, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly. And while he was an intern, Hasan had some ""difficulties"" that required counseling and extra supervision, said Dr. Thomas Grieger, who was the training director at the time.

Thirteen people were killed and 30 others injured in the shooting rampage at the Texas Army post on Thursday. The suspected shooter is an Army psychiatrist; his motive remains unclear. ""We don't know all the answers yet. And I would caution against jumping to conclusions until we have all the facts,"" Obama said in a Rose Garden statement otherwise devoted to the economy. ""What we do know is that there are families, friends and an entire nation grieving right now for the valiant men and women who came under attack yesterday,"" the president said. His aides, meanwhile, worked to make way for Obama to attend a still unscheduled memorial service for those slain at the nation's largest military post. The White House's top spokesman said Obama would attend that service and emphasized it would take place at the family's convenience, and that it will not be dictated by the president's schedule. ""When a service is scheduled, the president will attend,"" Robert Gibbs told reporters during his daily briefing. Yet Obama is also scheduled to leave on a 10-day trip to Asia on Wednesday.

Army psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan, suspect in the assault that killed 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, and hurt 30, salved the emotional wounds of troops returning from war even as he objected to his own looming deployment and argued with fellow soldiers who supported U.S. war policy, say those who know him professionally and personally. He was a counselor who once required counseling for himself because of trouble he had dealing with some patients, said a former boss. Authorities on Friday seized Hasan's home computer, searched his apartment and took away a Dumpster as the 39-year-old Army major lay in a coma in the hospital, attached to a ventilator. There are many unknowns about the man authorities say is responsible for the worst mass killing on a U.S. military base. Most of all, his motive. For six years before reporting for duty at Fort Hood, in July, Hasan worked at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center pursuing his career in psychiatry, as an intern, a resident and, last year, a fellow in disaster and preventive psychiatry. He received his medical degree from the military's Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., in 2001. While an intern at Walter Reed, Hasan had some ""difficulties"" that required counseling and extra supervision, said Dr. Thomas Grieger, who was the training director at the time. Grieger said privacy laws prevented him from going into details but noted that the problems had to do with Hasan's interactions with patients. He recalled Hasan as a ""mostly very quiet"" person who never spoke ill of the military or his country. ""He swore an oath of loyalty to the military,"" Grieger said. ""I didn't hear anything contrary to those oaths."" But, more recently, federal agents grew suspicious. At least six months ago, Hasan came to the attention of law enforcement officials because of Internet postings about suicide bombings and other threats, including posts that equated suicide bombers to soldiers who throw themselves on a grenade to save the lives of their comrades. They had not confirmed Hasan is the author of the posting, and a formal investigation had not been opened before the shooting, said law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the case. Federal authorities seized Hasan's computer Friday during a search of his apartment in Killeen, Texas, said a U.S. military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation. In an interview with The Washington Post, Hasan's aunt, Noel Hasan of Falls Church, Va., said he had been harassed about being a Muslim in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and he wanted to get out of the Army. ""Some people can take it and some people cannot,"" she said. ""He had listened to all of that and he wanted out of the military."" She said he had sought a discharge for several years, and even offered to repay the cost of his medical training. A military official told The Associated Press that Hasan was in the preparation stage of deployment, which can take months. The official said Hasan had indicated he didn't want to go to Iraq but was willing to serve in Afghanistan. The official did not have authorization to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. A second military official said Hasan's family has Palestinian roots. There have been reports that he was harassed for his Muslim religion, but the official says there is no indication Hasan filed a complaint with military officials about that. Alice Thompson, the manager at the apartment complex where Hasan lived, said he'd been living there since mid-August. Thompson said she didn't talk to him other than to say hello in passing. Thompson said he always answered her ""How are you?"" with ""I am blessed."" Noel Hasan said her nephew ""did not make many friends"" and would say ""the military was his life."" A cousin, Nader Hasan, told The New York Times that after counseling soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with post-traumatic stress disorder, Hasan knew the scars of war well. ""He was mortified by the idea of having to deploy,"" Nader Hasan said. ""He had people telling him on a daily basis the horrors they saw over there."" Retired Army Col. Terry Lee, who said he worked with Hasan, told Fox News that Hasan had hoped President Barack Obama would pull troops out of Afghanistan and Iraq. Lee said Hasan got into frequent arguments with others in the armed forces who supported the wars, and had tried hard to prevent his pending deployment. Col. Kimberly Kesling, deputy commander of clinical services at Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood, said she had known Hasan. ""You wouldn't think that someone who works in your facility and provided excellent care for his patients, which he did, could do something like this,"" Kesling said. She described him as ""a quiet man who wouldn't seek the limelight"" and said she was shocked when she heard he was the suspect in the shootings. Hasan attended prayers regularly when he lived outside Washington, often in his Army uniform, said Faizul Khan, a former imam at a mosque Hasan attended in Silver Spring, Md. He said Hasan was a lifelong Muslim. ""I got the impression that he was a committed soldier,"" Khan said. He spoke often with Hasan about Hasan's desire for a wife. On a form filled out by those seeking spouses through a program at the mosque, Hasan listed his birthplace as Arlington, Va., but his nationality as Palestinian, Khan said. ""We hardly ever got to discussing politics,"" Khan said. ""Mostly we were discussing religious matters, nothing too controversial, nothing like an extremist."" Hasan earned his rank of major in April 2008, according to a July 2008 Army Times article. He served eight years as an enlisted soldier. Military records show he also served in the ROTC as an undergraduate at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg and received a bachelor's degree in biochemistry there in 1997. But college officials said Friday that Hasan graduated with honors in biochemistry in 1995 and there was no record of him serving in any ROTC program. He previously had attended Barstow Community College in Barstow, Calif., and Virginia Western Community College in Roanoke, Va., according to Virginia Tech records. ___ Associated Press writers Lara Jakes, Pam Hess, Lolita C.

23362,48488,15756,"13 dead, 30 wounded in dual attacks at Fort Hood, Texas",1762,Bearer of the Sword,"Assalamu alaykum, This is exactly what I have been proposing,well,at least in my personal writings,for Muslims to carry out duties of individual jihad,in face of security problems that deter one from forming an organized domestic group to carry out Jihad. Here is what I wrote more than one year ago.------ 20TH AND 21ST CENTURY'S JIHAD DEMANDS INDIVIDUAL INTEREST AND PARTICIPATION .IT HAS TO BE PEOPLE'S JIHAD.EVERY MUSLIM AND MUSLIMAT ON THE STREET HAVE TO FIGHT WITH ANYTHING AT HAND,FROM A SHARPENED STONE TO A PLANE LOAD OF EXPLOSIVES.IN THAT WAY WE CAN MAKE UP FOR THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE ARMIES OF THE SO-CALLED MUSLIM STATES IN DEFENDING ISLAM,OUR HONOR,OUR PEOPLE;INSHAALLAH. AND ALLAH (SWT) KNOWS THE BEST. After a little time of writing this ,I came to know about the greatest military theoretician our Ummah have had in this age,Shaykh Abu Musab as Suri(HA).I really fell to find any one of as much calibre in the whole world,at present,to pronounce so practical, and so feasible, operating styles for mujahideen.Luckily for us,this individualized version of jihadi attacks,along with a lot of other type of tactics, was presented to us in his huge book,The Call for Global Islamic Resistance.Due to my poor knowledge of Arabic,I haven't been able to read much from the original text,but whatever I read from Brynjar Lia's itty bitty translation of few chapters,one thing was clear: the kuffar cant stop this,inshaAllah. It would be an injustice to call it guerrilla warfare.Its way different and evolved.Maybe we should simply call it mujahideen tactics! And here we have Abdul Hakim Mujahid Muhammad(may Allah free him) executing this mode of attack,perhaps a few more failed attempts by others,and now,this shining Knight of Islam,Malik Nidal Hasan(may Allah free him),carrying out the duty,which so many of us are still shirking. I really hope this becomes a trend. Also this points to the uselessness of trying to procure explosives in US,when all u need are firearms ! Procuring explosive-making materials almost always is monitored now. U need fertilizers,timers, and a host of other stuff,not to forget the skills needed for making one explosive(they are not only tough to make,but extremely dangerous for the maker).These products can all be traced to the shops,and our obedient shopkeeper would only have to put out a CCTV footage and bang ! Months of preparations goes down the drain,as well as the brother's freedom. On the contrary,almost throughout the land,even teenagers can procure guns,that cannot be monitored beforehand,and in many cases cannot be even traced afterwards.Kids can buy guns in heartland America.ATF is a sitting duck in front of this.Moreover,u go to gun shows,u get much lesser exposure;enough not to tip off paranoid feds.U can then go and kill whomever u wish,maybe your pedophile neighbor,or better, a uniformed faggot.U don't even need to be in the army or police to do that,all u need is some dollars to spend on those shooting ranges,to hone your skills.And also,u don't need to buy any assault rifle too ! Handguns are enough,as it is being repeatedly proved. Thinking about what happens afterwards is unnecessary.Either way,if u were really serious about carrying out an attack,first of all u would have been thinking about a martyrdom bombing.I think its more gratifying to see your enemy die before you go down. U make your journey,when your time comes,with a known accomplishment. On a side note, after the recent shooting of Brit kuffar in Afghanistan by an undercover mujahid,and after this incident in the US homeland,things are going to get pretty bad in kuffar-murtadeen relations,inshaAllaah. 1.kuffar trainers would be scared shitless, to even go near recruits bearing Muslim names.Really bad business for “American Muslim soldiers”and“Awakening Councils”(I read a report a while ago ,when murtadeen sahwa tribal leaders met with marine commanders,sahwa gunmen around the leaders were disarmed.Wondering what measures are they gonna take now!) 2.narcoanalysis and other lie detection techniques, might be used now in much greater frequency while recruting a Muslim soldier.More hurdles means more shame for the recruits,more shame means more cowards and useless people filling the positions of dead and disfigured GIs ! 3.In short,sleepless times for those who want more focus on brainwashing our people and deviating them into the kuffar folds,due to obvious scary prospect of contacting Muslims.",2009,11,06,2009-11-06 00:00:00.000,48272

23401,48552,15756,"13 dead, 30 wounded in dual attacks at Fort Hood, Texas",10,Asadullah Alshishani,"The 13 people killed when an Army psychiatrist allegedly opened fire on fellow soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas, included a pregnant woman who was preparing to return home, a man who quit a furniture company job to join the military about a year ago, a newlywed who had served in Iraq and a woman who had vowed to take on Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Here is a look at some of the victims. ___ Francheska Velez Velez, 21, of Chicago, was pregnant and preparing to return home. A friend of Velez's, Sasha Ramos, described her as a fun-loving person who wrote poetry and loved dancing. ""She was like my sister,"" Ramos, 21, said. ""She was the most fun and happy person you could know. She never did anything wrong to anybody."" Family members said Velez had recently returned from deployment in Iraq and had sought a lifelong career in the Army. ""She was a very happy girl and sweet,"" said her father, Juan Guillermo Velez, his eyes red from crying. ""She had the spirit of a child."" Ramos, who also served briefly in the military, couldn't reconcile that her friend was killed in this country — just after leaving a war zone. ""It makes it a lot harder,"" she said. ""This is not something a soldier expects — to have someone in our uniform go start shooting at us."" ___ Pfc. Aaron Thomas Nemelka Nemelka, 19, of the Salt Lake City suburb of West Jordan, Utah, chose to join the Army instead of going on a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, his uncle Christopher Nemelka said. ""As a person, Aaron was as soft and kind and as gentle as they come, a sweetheart,"" his uncle said. ""What I loved about the kid was his independence of thought."" Aaron Nemelka, the youngest of four children, was scheduled to be deployed to Afghanistan in January, his family said in a statement. Nemelka had enlisted in the Army in October 2008, Utah National Guard Lt. Col. Lisa Olsen said. ___ Pfc. Michael Pearson Pearson, 21, of the Chicago suburb of Bolingbrook, Ill., quit what he figured was a dead-end furniture company job to join the military about a year ago. ""He felt he was in a rut. He wanted to travel, see the world,"" his mother, Sheryll Pearson, told the Chicago Tribune. ""He also wanted an opportunity to serve the country."" At Pearson's family home Friday, a yellow ribbon was tied to a porch light and a sticker stamped with American flags on the front door read, ""United we stand."" Neighbor Jessica Koerber, who was with Pearson's parents when they received word Thursday their son had died, described him as a man who clearly loved his family — someone who enjoyed horsing around with his nieces and nephews, and other times playing his guitar. ""That family lost their gem,"" she told the AP. ""He was a great kid, a great guy. ... Mikey was one of a kind."" Sheryll Pearson said she hadn't seen her son for a year because he had been training. She told the Tribune that when she last talked to him on the phone two days ago, they had discussed how he would come home for Christmas. ___ Spc. Jason Dean Hunt Hunt, 22, of Frederick, Okla., went into the military after graduating from Tipton High School in 2005 and had gotten married just two months ago, his mother, Gale Hunt, said. He had served 3 1/2 years in the Army, including a stint in Iraq. Gale Hunt said two uniformed soldiers came to her door late Thursday night to notify her of her son's death. Hunt, known as J.D., was ""just kind of a quiet boy and a good kid, very kind,"" said Kathy Gray, an administrative assistant at Tipton Schools. His mother said he was family oriented. ""He didn't go in for hunting or sports,"" Gale Hunt said. ""He was a very quiet boy who enjoyed video games."" He had re-enlisted for six years after serving his initial two-year assignment, she said. Jason Hunt was previously stationed at Fort Stewart in Georgia. ___ Sgt. Amy Krueger Krueger, 29, of Kiel, Wis., joined the Army after the 2001 terrorist attacks and had vowed to take on Osama bin Laden, her mother, Jeri Krueger said. Amy Krueger arrived at Fort Hood on Tuesday and was scheduled to be sent to Afghanistan in December, the mother told the Herald Times Reporter of Manitowoc. Jeri Krueger recalled telling her daughter that she could not take on bin Laden by herself. ""Watch me,"" her daughter replied. Kiel High School Principal Dario Talerico told The Associated Press that Krueger graduated from the school in 1998 and had spoken at least once to local elementary school students about her career. ""I just remember that Amy was a very good kid, who like most kids in a small town are just looking for what their next step in life was going to be and she chose the military,"" Talerico said. ""Once she got into the military, she really connected with that kind of lifestyle and was really proud to serve her country."" ___ Kham Xiong Kham Xiong, 23, of St. Paul, Minn., graduated from Community of Peace Academy in 2004. ""The sad part is that he had been taught and been trained to protect and to fight. Yet it's such a tragedy that he did not have the opportunity to protect himself and the base,"" his father, Chor Xiong, told KSTP-TV through an interpreter. Xiong's 17-year-old brother, Robert, described Kham as ""the family clown, just a real good outgoing guy."" Community of Peace Academy Principal Tim McGowan told the AP that Chor Xiong informed the charter school of his son's death. Family members picked up pictures of Xiong on Friday for a memorial service, McGowan said. ""He was just a well-rounded individual with a great personality. He was very fun-loving, one who brought a smile to everyone's face he came across,"" McGowan said. ___ Associated Press writers Amy Forliti in St. Paul, Minn., Jennifer Dobner in Salt Lake City, Richard Green in Oklahoma City and Sophia Tareen, Michael Tarm and Amy Shafer in Chicago contributed to this report.

23402,48553,15756,"13 dead, 30 wounded in dual attacks at Fort Hood, Texas",10,Asadullah Alshishani,"FORT HOOD, Texas – As if going off to war, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan cleaned out his apartment, gave leftover frozen broccoli to one neighbor and called another to thank him for his friendship — common courtesies and routines of the departing soldier. Instead, authorities say, he went on the killing spree that left 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, dead. Investigators examined Hasan's computer, his home and his garbage Friday to learn what motivated the suspect, who lay in a coma, shot four times in the frantic bloodletting that also wounded 30. Hospital officials said some of the wounded had extremely serious injuries and might not survive. The 39-year-old Army psychiatrist emerged as a study in contradictions: a polite man who stewed with discontent, a counselor who needed to be counseled himself, a professional healer now suspected of cutting down the fellow soldiers he was sworn to help. Relatives said he felt harassed because of his Muslim faith but did not embrace extremism. Others were not so sure. A recent classmate said Hasan once gave a jarring presentation to students in which he argued the war on terrorism was a war against Islam, and ""made himself a lightning rod for things"" when he felt his religious beliefs were challenged. Investigators were trying to piece together how and why Hasan allegedly gunned down his comrades in the worst case of violence on a military base in the U.S. The rampage unfolded at a center where some 300 unarmed soldiers were lined up for vaccines and eye tests. Soldiers reported that the gunman shouted ""Allahu Akbar!"" — an Arabic phrase for ""God is great!"" — before opening fire Thursday, said Lt. Gen. Robert Cone, the base commander. He said officials had not confirmed Hasan made the comment. Hasan's family said in a statement Friday that his alleged actions were deplorable and don't reflect how the family was reared. ""Our family is filled with grief for the victims and their families involved in yesterday's tragedy,"" said Nader Hasan, a cousin who lives in northern Virginia. ""We are mortified with what has unfolded and there is no justification, whatsoever, for what happened. We are all asking why this happened, and the answer is that we simply do not know."" The wounded were dispersed among hospitals in central Texas. W. Roy Smythe, chairman of surgery at Scott and White Memorial Hospital, said several patients were still at ""significant risk"" of losing their lives. The dead included a pregnant woman who was preparing to return home, a man who quit a furniture company job to join the military about a year ago, a newlywed who had served in Iraq and a woman who had vowed to take on Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Army Chief of Staff George Casey said he asked bases around the country to assess their security. He also said he was worried about a backlash against the thousands of Muslim soldiers serving dutifully in uniform. Hasan was due to be deployed to Afghanistan to help soldiers with combat stress, a task he'd done stateside with returning soldiers, the Army said. Army spokeswoman Col. Cathy Abbott was uncertain when Hasan was to leave but he was in the preparation stage of deployment, which can take months. In any event, the major was saying goodbyes and dispensing belongings to neighbors. Jose Padilla, the owner of Hasan's apartment complex, said Hasan gave him notice two weeks ago that he was moving out this week. Earlier this week, Hasan asked Padilla his native language. When Padilla said it was Spanish, Hasan immediately went up to his apartment to get him a Spanish-language Quran. Padilla said Hasan also refused to reclaim his deposit and last month's rent, surrendering $400 that the major said should go to someone who needed it. ""I cannot comprehend that the enemy was among us,"" Padilla said, tearing up. ""I feel a little guilt that I was basically giving housing to someone who is going to do so much destruction."" Neighbor Patricia Villa said Hasan came to her apartment the day of the shooting, and before, to give her vegetables, an air mattress, T-shirts, a Quran and offer her $60 to clean his Killeen, Texas, apartment after he left. Jacqueline Harris, 44, who lives with her boyfriend Willie Bell in the apartment next door to Hasan, said he called Thursday at 5 a.m. and left a message. ""He just wanted to thank Willie for being a good friend and thank him for being there for him,"" Harris said. ""That was it. We thought it was just a nice message to leave."" Bell said Hasan offered a farewell, saying ""nice knowing you, old friend. I'm going to miss you."" According to a Killeen police report in August, an Army employee was charged with scratching Hasan's car, causing $1,000 in damage. Apartment manager John Thompson said the man charged was a soldier back from Iraq, who objected to Hasan's faith and ripped a bumper sticker off the major's car that said: ""Allah is Love."" Kim Rosenthal, another neighbor, said Hasan didn't seem too upset by his scratched vehicle, even though it was damaged so badly that he got a new one. ""He said it was Ramadan and that he had to forgive people,"" Rosenthal said. ""He forgave him and moved on."" Hasan appeared less forgiving to Dr. Val Finnell when they were classmates in a 2007-08 master's public health program at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md. She said that at a class presentation by public health students, at which topics like dry cleaning chemicals and house mold were discussed, Hasan talked about U.S. military actions as a war on Islam. Hasan made clear he was a ""vociferous opponent"" of U.S. wars in Muslim countries, Finnell said. ""He made himself a lightning rod for things,"" she said. ""No one picked on him because he was a Muslim."" Law enforcement officials said they are trying to confirm if Hasan wrote Internet postings that include his name about suicide bombings and other threats, equating suicide bombers to soldiers who throw themselves on a grenade to save the life of fellow soldiers. Hasan is the Arlington, Va.-born son of Palestinian parents who ran a restaurant and bar in Roanoke, Va., from 1987 to 1995, and owned a small grocery store in that city. His relatives in the West Bank said they had heard from family members that Hasan felt mistreated in the Army as a Muslim. ""He told (them) that as a Muslim committed to his prayers he was discriminated against and not treated as is fitting for an officer and American,"" said Mohammed Malik Hasan, 24, a cousin. ""He hired a lawyer to get him a discharge."" Mohammed Hasan said outside his home in Ramallah that he heard about the shooting from a relative. ""I was surprised, honestly, because the guy and his brothers are so calm, and he, as I know, loves his work."" Nidal Hasan is the eldest of three brothers. One brother, Annas, lives in Ramallah with a wife and daughter, and practices law. The youngest brother, Eyad, lives in Virginia. ""We don't mix with them a lot,"" Mohammed said. ""Nidal like to stay alone, he was very calm. He minded his own business."" Hasan graduated from medical school at the Uniformed Services University in 2003, said Sharon K. Willis, speaking for the school. He then entered a psychiatry residency program at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, which he completed in 2007. He returned to the university for the disaster and military psychiatry fellowship in 2007. Phase one of that the fellowship is earning a master of public health degree, which he completed in 2008. He completed the fellowship program in June. A month later, Hasan reported for duty at Fort Hood. ___ Blackledge reported from Washington. Associated Press writers Lara Jakes, Lolita C.

23474,48706,15343,Feds: Leader of radical Islam group killed in raid,843,Cmdr,"Windsor men wanted by FBI granted bail Quote: WINDSOR, Ont. — The two Windsor men arrested last week in connection with a radical Islamic group are out on bail. Mohammad Al-Sahli, 33, and Yassir Ali Khan, 30, were released from custody Friday afternoon following an agreement between defense and Crown representatives, with the approval of the Superior Court of Justice. Defence lawyer Patrick Ducharme hailed the decision as the “proper” one. “There was really no flight risk here at all,” Ducharme said. “These fellas don’t have any prior record. They’ve got long-standing ties to the community.” U.S. federal authorities had requested that both Al-Sahli and Khan be denied bail. Prosecutor Tom Lemon said the Attorney General of Canada took that request into account — “However, we have to consider all of the circumstances.” Outside the courthouse, Ducharme again challenged U.S. federal authorities to provide proof that his clients are aligned with an extremist organization trying to overthrow the U.S. government. “I suspect that (U.S. authorities) won’t have one scintilla of evidence that these gentlemen have any ties with anyone who was seeking to do that. And if they did (have ties), it would certainly be without their knowledge.” 'Terrorism' case with no terrorism charges, now these guys easily released on bail. Is this whole thing just more nonsense from the zio-Nazi US Federal Government? http://www.windsorstar.com/news/Wind...446/story.html",2009,11,07,2009-11-07 00:00:00.000,46641

Network)--A large demonstration against al-Shabab orders has taken place in Baidoa, the former parliamentary seat in southern Somalia on Wednesday, witnesses told Shabelle radio. Al-Shabab administration in Baidoa banned on Tuesday Khat, a popular stimulant chewed across east Africa to be sold inside the town. They have also banned vehicles with tinted windows except for Al Shabaab officials. The demonstrators, mostly traders of the Khat, blocked the streets of Baidoa and were throwing stones to al-Shabab individuals and the cars that were using the streets of the town for hours before they were dispersed with gunfire by al-Shabab fighters. At least one person has been reportedly wounded and more than fifty people have been taken to jails. The protestors were angry by the ban of the Khat. Al-Shabab officials declined to talk about the incident. Baidoa and other major towns in south Somalia are under the control of al-Shabab Islamists. i wondered when this was going to happen, see baidoa is halfway between the moqdishu and the kenya/ethipian borders and is a place a lot of mafia hang around and use it as a stop off, also mafia will always be a problem for new islamic state because we put them out of business, it would be wise to teach them an alternative trade and even give them land to farm.",2009,03,26,2009-03-26 00:00:00.000,3545

I could honestly say that this man was NO Radical. He was a compassionate man, a man who gave to not only muslims but to christians,jews and any who needed help. His knowledge of Islam was vast and he once told me that he lived every moment as if Allah was right beside him. He helped on a problem I had with my anger the last time I saw him a few months ago. The one thing that really stuck in my mind was....if you get angry to quickly....you already lost the battle. Rather he told me that become angry at those who disobey Allah and embrace those who obey,worship and love Allah. When I heard the news at Jummah the following day...I was at awe. I did not even believe it. Then when I searched on the internet, my heart stopped. How can such a compassionate man who stood firm in the deen become another statistic in Detroit.

23671,49089,15756,"13 dead, 30 wounded in dual attacks at Fort Hood, Texas",10,Asadullah Alshishani,"FORT HOOD, Texas – The man accused of killing 13 people and wounding 29 at Fort Hood is able to talk, a hospital spokesman said Monday, but it's unknown when investigators might take advantage of his improving health to press forward with their probe into the shooting spree. Authorities say Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan fired off more than 100 rounds Thursday before civilian police shot him in the torso. He was taken into custody and eventually moved to an Army hospital in San Antonio, where he was in stable condition and able to talk, said Dewey Mitchell, a Brooke Army Medical Center spokesman. Authorities continue to refer to Hasan, 39, as the only suspect in the shootings, but they won't say when charges would be filed and have said they have not determined a motive. A spokesman for Army investigators did not immediately respond to calls and e-mails seeking comment Monday. Sixteen victims remained hospitalized with gunshot wounds, and seven were in intensive care. The personal Web site for a radical American imam living in Yemen who had contact with two 9/11 hijackers praised Hasan as a hero. The posting Monday on the Web site for Anwar al Awlaki, who was a spiritual leader at two mosques where three 9/11 hijackers worshipped, said American Muslims who condemned the Fort Hood attack are hypocrites who have committed treason against their religion. Awlaki said the only way a Muslim can justify serving in the U.S. military is if he intends to ""follow in the footsteps of men like Nidal."" ""Nidal Hassan is a hero,"" Awlaki said. ""He is a man of conscience who could not bear living the contradiction of being a Muslim and serving in an army that is fighting against his own people."" Two U.S. intelligence officials told The Associated Press the Web site was Awlaki's. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence collection. Awlaki did not immediately respond to an attempt to contact him through the Web site. Hasan's family attended the Dar al Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Va., where Awlaki was preaching in 2001. Hasan's mother's funeral was held at the mosque on May 31, 2001, according to her obituary in the Roanoke Times newspaper, around the same time two 9/11 hijackers worshipped at the mosque and while Awlaki was preaching. Awlaki is a native-born U.S. citizen who left the United States in 2002, eventually traveling to Yemen. He was released from a Yemeni jail last year and has since gone missing. He is on Yemen's most wanted militant list, according to three Yemeni security officials. The officials say Awlaki was arrested in 2006 with a small group of suspected al-Qaida militants in the capital San'a. They say he was released more than a year later after signing a pledge he will not break the law or leave the country. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. The Falls Church mosque is one of the largest on the East Coast, and thousands of worshippers attend prayers and services there every week. Imam Johari Abdul-Malik, outreach director at Dar al Hijrah, said he did not know whether Hasan ever attended the mosque but confirmed that the Hasan family participated in services there. Abdul-Malik said the Hasans were not leaders at the mosque and their attendance was normal. The London Telegraph first reported the potential link between Hasan and the mosque. Sen. Joe Lieberman said Sunday he wants Congress to determine whether the shootings constitute a terrorist attack and whether warning signs that Hasan was embracing an increasingly extremist view of Islamic ideology were missed. Classmates who participated in a 2007-2008 master's program at a military college told The Associated Press that they complained to faculty during the program about what they considered to be Hasan's anti-American views, which included his giving a presentation that justified suicide bombing and telling classmates that Islamic law trumped the U.S. Constitution. ""If Hasan was showing signs, saying to people that he had become an Islamist extremist, the U.S. Army has to have zero tolerance,"" Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""He should have been gone."" Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Casey said Sunday it's important for the country not to get caught up in speculation about Hasan's Muslim faith, and he has instructed his commanders to be on the lookout for anti-Muslim reaction to the killings at the Texas post. Casey, who appeared on ABC's ""This Week"" and CNN's ""State of the Union,"" said evidence to this point shows that Hasan acted alone. President Barack Obama is scheduled to attend a memorial service Tuesday honoring victims of the attack, and he'll arrive to a post on the mend. Fort Hood spokesman Col. John Rossi said the country's largest military installation was moving forward with the business of soldiering. The processing center where Hasan allegedly opened fire remains a crime scene, but the activities that went on there were relocated, with the goal of soon reopening the center. ""There's a lot of routine activity still happening. You'll hear cannon fire and artillery fire,"" Rossi said. ""Soldiers in units are still trying to execute the missions we have been tasked with."" Sgt. 1st Class Frank Minnie was in the processing center last week getting some health tests and immunizations in preparation for his deployment. Minnie said that even after the shootings, Fort Hood soldiers have the attitude that ""the mission still goes on."" ""Everybody's going to grieve a little bit. It hurts a lot because it's one of your battle buddies, and someone lost a mom, dad, brother or sister,"" said Minnie, 37, who served in Iraq in 2006. ""But it doesn't change my perspective of going to war. I've got a job to do."" ___ Associated Press writers Allen Breed and Jeff Carlton in Fort Hood, Eileen Sulivan and Devlin Barrett in Washington, Ben Nuckols in Baltimore, Matthew Barakat in McLean, Va., and Ahmed al-Haj in San-a, Yamen, contributed to this report.",2009,11,09,2009-11-09 00:00:00.000,48272

Wa ‘Alaykum as-Salaam, Brother the troubles with the Sheikh Mansour and his grouping (Amir Abu Bakr, Amir Musa, Sheikh Imam) have beening going on for years now, since Fall 2007 when he split with Amir Abu Usman (Hafidhuhullah) and the Mujahideen who chose to follow the path of declaring an Islamic Emirate encompassing all the Muslim areas of the Caucasus. His position seems to be that he is a nationalist who wants CHRI and all its structures and he does not support the Emirate and says Amir had no right to declare it. No he has not joined the Rusnya Scum or their Kaifrov henchmen, but he has not joined the Mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate either and sadly he has allied himself with the criminal scum in London and other places in Europe who have their so called ""Telephone Parliament and CHRI Government who have active Mujahideen Units all over Chechnya carrying out daily combat actions"". I should remind here that these criminals in Europe are people who accuse Isa Umarov (Hafidhuhullah) , Sheikh Seif al-Islam (Hafidhuhullah), Sheikh Said (Hafidhuhullah) and Yassir al-Sudani (Hafidhuhullah) to be FSB and CIA agents who are ""controlling everything in the Caucasus."" All Caucasian Mujahideen who this criminal Zakayev does not like he says are FSB agents and all Immigrant brothers are CIA agents. He, Zakayev has said so much slander in the last 2 years and Sheikh Mansour knows this is not true he lived everyday for years with these brothers, why does he not speak out against these lies. Also go to their website and look at the videos posted there, there are no attacks against Rusnya troops and Kaifrov scum only lectures and daily life. Insha'allah I would love nothing more then for then Sheikh to return as I love him and respect him as do all the Mujahideen and Muslims of the Caucasus. His position seems to be a nationalist one who wants the return of CHRI and all its structures as opposed to the Islamic Emirate and allies himself with Zakayev and his people in Europe. Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala) knows best I also want to remind that Alhamdulillah the Sharia Court recently passed a sentence against Zakayev for his crimes.",2009,11,12,2009-11-12 00:00:00.000,1403

24036,49754,15756,"13 dead, 30 wounded in dual attacks at Fort Hood, Texas",564,moak,"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Those who knew Nidal Malik Hasan before he was a major in the Army -- and the suspect in last week's mass killing at Fort Hood -- say he was long known for militant Islamist views. Doctors who crossed paths with Hasan in medical programs paint a picture of a subpar student who wore his religious views on his sleeve. Several doctors who knew Hasan spoke to CNN, but only on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation of the shooting, which left 12 soldiers and one civilian dead and dozens of other people wounded. Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who faces 13 counts of premeditated murder, ""was clearly espousing Islamist ideology"" during his time as a medical student at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, one of his former classmates told CNN. Hasan's family has revealed little about him, saying in media interviews that Hasan was a ""good American"" and a lifelong Muslim who complained he was harassed in the Army because of his religion. His former classmates describe a much more militant Hasan. His presentations for school were often laced with extremist Muslim views, one source said. ""Is your allegiance to Sharia law or the United States?"" students once challenged Hasan, the source said. ""Sharia law,"" Hasan responded, according to the source. The incident was corroborated by another doctor who was present. The source recalled another instance in which Hasan was asked if the U.S. Constitution was a brilliant document. Hasan replied, ""No, not particularly,"" according to the source. The former classmate told CNN that he voiced concerns about Hasan to supervisors at the school. A second former medical school colleague of Hasan said several people raised concerns about Hasan's overall competence. Even though Hasan earned his medical degree and residency, some of his fellow students believed Hasan ""didn't have the intellect"" to be in the program and was not academically rigorous in his coursework. Hasan ""was not fit to be in the military, let alone in the mental health profession,"" this classmate told CNN. ""No one in class would ever have referred a patient to him or trusted him with anything."" The first classmate echoed this sentiment. Hasan was ""coddled, accommodated and pushed through that masters of public health despite substandard performance,"" the classmate said. He was ""put in the fellowship program because they didn't know what to do with him."" The second classmate said he witnessed at least two of Hasan's PowerPoint discussions that included what he described as extremist views. In these presentations, which were supposed to be about health, Hasan justified suicide bombings and spoke about the persecution of Muslims in the Middle East, in the United States and in the U.S. military, the source said. Some in the crowd rolled their eyes or muttered under their breath, he said, and others were clearly uncomfortable. Those in the audience, which included program supervisors, did not loudly object to Hasan's presentations, but did complain to their higher-ups afterward. The supervisors expressed ""appreciation, understanding and agreement"" that the complaints would be discussed, but it was unclear what action, if any, came, the source said. When the classmate challenged Hasan personally, Hasan dodged the questions, the source said. Despite the controversy that his schoolwork created, classmates did not view Hasan as mentally unstable or psychotic, the source said. Questions remain over how much Hasan's behavior and actions in school were reflected in his personnel files. Col. Kimberly Kesling, deputy commander of Clinical Services for Darnell Medical Center at Fort Hood and Hasan's supervisor at the post, told reporters last week that Hasan was doing a good job in Texas. ""As a supervisor, I am aware of the job performance of people coming into our organization, that is part of our credentialing process,"" Kesling said. ""The types of things that were reported to me via his evaluation report were things that concerned me, but did not raise red flags toward this [the shootings] in any way, shape, or form."" ""His evaluation reports said that he had some difficulties in his residency, fitting into his residency, and we worked very hard to integrate him into our practice and into our organization, and he adapted very well, was doing a really good job for us,"" she said. Prompted by reports of former classmates, however, Army investigators would like to speak with people who have had contact with Hasan and who may have information about his activities and behavior, Maj. Gen Kevin Bergner, head of U.S. Army public affairs, said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates weighed in on the information surfacing about Hasan. ""I deplore the leaks that have taken place,"" he said on a trip to Oshkosh, Wisconsin. People are talking about ""what they know, which is one small piece of the puzzle."" ""They don't know whether or not what they're leaking might jeopardize a potential criminal investigation and trial,"" he said. ""People who have a piece of this, frankly, ought to keep quiet and let the authorities go forward on this in an organized and comprehensive way,"" Gates said. Hasan came under investigation last year when his contacts with radical imam Anwar al-Awlaki were intercepted by terrorism investigators monitoring the cleric's communications, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. An employee of the Defense Department's Criminal Investigative Services, assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force, decided to drop the investigation after reviewing the intercepted communications and Hasan's personnel files. Hasan remained hospitalized Thursday from gunshot wounds he received from two police officers who responded to last week's shooting.

24094,49829,15756,"13 dead, 30 wounded in dual attacks at Fort Hood, Texas",10,Asadullah Alshishani,"FORT HOOD, Texas – The Army psychiatrist charged with killing 13 people in a shooting spree at Fort Hood made or accepted wire transfers with Pakistan, a country wracked by Muslim extremist violence, a Republican congressman said Friday. Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the ranking GOP member of the House Homeland Security Intelligence Subcommittee, said in a statement that he confirmed through ""independent sources"" that Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan also had communications with Pakistan. ""This Pakistan connection just raises more red flags about this case and demonstrates why it's important for Congress to exercise its oversight authority,"" McCaul said in a statement. McCaul did not respond Friday to a request for an interview. His spokesman, Mike Rosen, said he did not know the direction of the transfers and communications, only that they passed between Hasan and Pakistan. Rosen would not elaborate further and said he could not say how McCaul's sources knew about the transfers, their value, to whom they were placed or accepted or how many accounts were involved. Hasan, 39, was charged Thursday with 13 counts of premeditated murder in a military court, and Army investigators have said he could face additional charges. His attorney, John Galligan, has said prosecutors have not yet told him whether they plan to seek the death penalty. A pair of civilian police officers responding to last week's attack, in which 43 people were also injured, including 34 with gunshot wounds, shot Hasan four times. Recovering in the intensive care unit at San Antonio's Brooke Army Medical Center, Hasan has told his attorney he has no feeling in his legs and extreme pain in his hands. Galligan said doctors have told Hasan he may be permanently paralyzed from the waist down. He called his client's medical condition ""extremely serious"" and said Hasan didn't flinch when Galligan touched his leg during a meeting Thursday, when one of Hasan's relatives was able to see him for the first time since he was hospitalized. Hospital spokesman Dewey Mitchell said he could not confirm whether Hasan was paralyzed, since Hasan has directed hospital officials not to release any information about his condition or injuries. The question of how Hasan spent his Army salary stems from the apparently frugal lifestyle he lived both in the small city of Killeen, Texas, outside of Fort Hood, and in the Washington, D.C., suburbs when stationed at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. In Texas, he lived in a rundown apartment that cost $350 a month and drove a 2006 Honda. As an Army major with more than 12 years of service, Hasan earns just over $92,000 a year in basic pay and housing and food allowances, according to pay tables from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service. Hasan's gross monthly salary is $6,325.50 a month, or $75,906 annually. He also gets $1,128 a month for a housing allowance and $223 a month for meals, which adds up to another $16,212 a year. Military psychiatrists may also receive as much as $20,000 a year in incentive pay, according to the tables. But to get the bonus, they must meet certain requirements, such as agreeing to remain on active duty for at least one year after accepting the award. Hasan's Army records are sealed due to the ongoing investigation, and it isn't clear if he was eligible for the bonus or agreed to the conditions. President Barack Obama has ordered a review of all intelligence related to Hasan and whether the information was properly shared and acted upon within government agencies. Several members of Congress, particularly Michigan Rep. Peter Hoekstra, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, have also called for a full examination of what agencies knew about Hasan's contacts with a radical Muslim cleric in Yemen and others of concern to the U.S. Hoekstra confirmed this week that government officials knew about 10 to 20 e-mails between Hasan and the radical imam, beginning in December 2008. A joint terrorism task force overseen by the FBI learned late last year of Hasan's repeated contact with the cleric, who encouraged Muslims to kill U.S. troops in Iraq. The FBI said the task force did not refer early information about Hasan to superiors because it concluded he wasn't linked to terrorism. ___ Gamboa reportered from Washington.

Abu Yazid said India would ""pay a hefty price for such transgression."" “We would mobilize the entire Muslim world with its mujahideen, and strike against your interests everywhere, until you collapse and become bankrupt, the same way America is collapsing and becoming bankrupt today,” he added. Abul Yazid had opened his message by offering his sympathy to Palestinians for the loss of lives and the devastation that was caused by the Israeli aggression on Gaza, saying that al Qaeda would fight the Zionists alongside Palestinians if they could cross the borders and get to Palestine. He then addressed the Pakistani people and offered his analysis of the current situation on the political arena in Pakistan, labelling Pakistani leaders as ""corrupt apostates"" and describing President Zardari as a “crook and a traitor.” He also claimed that due to the steadfastness of the mujahideen, the American ""crusader campaign"" was unable to carry through its plan aimed at dividing Pakistan. Abul Yazid warned of the support that the Americans have been giving to India, especially in the field of nuclear technology. He argued that the U.S. was trying to weaken Pakistan internally, until it becomes possible for India to take it over and divide it into smaller districts. In a scathing criticism of Pakistan’s role in the war on terror, Abul Yazid shamed the government over its weak response in the wake of the Mumbai attacks. He told his audience that sending the Pakistani intelligence chief to Delhi to provide officials there with all the information that they needed, and closing the offices of “jihadi” organizations undermined Pakistan's sovereignty. Abul Yazid also criticised the Pakistani government for “opening its air space before U.S. drones and providing U.S. Forces with intelligence, in order to let them kill the mujahidin tribal people and their foreign brethren jihadis.” The U.S. has intensified its drone attacks in the Pakistani tribal areas in the past six months killing a significant number of front-line al-Qaeda and Taliban commanders. Since August 31st, the CIA has carried out at least 38 predator strikes in northwest Pakistan compared with 10 attacks in 2006 and 2007 combined. Abul Yazid himself was rumored to have been killed in one of those attacks. Abu Yazid concluded his message by making an appeal to the various Islamic groups in Pakistan to join the battle against the ""crusader campaign"" and to the Pakistani people to rise and rebel against their leaders and rulers. “O’ Muslims of Pakistan, join your mujahideen brethren, help and support them and don’t refrain from sponsoring them and fighting along their side.” The language used by Abul Yazid resembles to a great extent that used by al Qaeda's second-in-command Ayman al Zawahiri in his message to the Pakistani people last August. Al Zawahiri criticized the Pakistani government at the time and urged Pakistanis to support the jihadi movement",2009,03,27,2009-03-27 00:00:00.000,4927

Harakat Al-shabab Mujahideen officials said that the fighting started as the forces of Sheik Ahmed Modobe, one of the previous Islamist officials of Hisbul Islam organization and ONLF guerrillas attacked the positions of the Islamist fighters of the Jubba regions under the control of Harakat Al-shabab Muhajideen claiming victory over the fighting on Monday morning. Locals in Hagar where the fighting started told Shabelle radio that the clashes broke out early on Monday morning pointing out that it is between the two warring sides who recently fought in the port town of Kismayu town the centre of Lower Jubba region. A statement issued by Harakat Al-shabab Mujahideen said that the forces of Sheik Ahmed Madobe and Oganden National Front (ONLF) had attacked the locations of the Islamist fighters Jubba regions in Hagar village in southern Somalia adding that they had the upper hand of the fighting. The statement said that the fighting continued for a while and killed at least 6 of the forces led by Sheik Ahmed Madobe who were involving the fighting. Latest reports say that the fighting restarted in the village once again as both sides are exchanging heavy weapons in the clashes and it is unclear the real casualties of the fighting which is currently going on there in southern Somalia. Sheik Hassan Yacqub Ali, head of the information affairs of the Islamist representatives of Jubba regions under the management of Harakat Al-shabab Mujahideen told reporters that the fighting started early morning as troops led by Ahmed Madobe backing by ONLF guerrillas attacked bases of the Islamist forces in the region claiming that they killed six of the fighters who were in the gun battle. There is comment from the other sides of the fighting so far. We shall keep updating you for any further details about the fighting as soon as possible.",2009,11,16,2009-11-16 00:00:00.000,3545

24589,50788,15756,"13 dead, 30 wounded in dual attacks at Fort Hood, Texas",10,Asadullah Alshishani,"Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Terrorist incidents over the past 12 months show that Islamic extremists within the U.S. increasingly are launching attacks against targets such as military bases, anti-terrorist experts said today. “The threat is now increasingly from within, from homegrown terrorists who are inspired by violent Islamist ideology to plan and execute attacks where they live,” Mitchell Silber, director of intelligence analysis for the New York City Police Department, said. Silber was among witnesses testifying to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which has started an investigation into events leading up to the Nov. 5 shooting rampage at Fort Hood, in which 13 people were killed and 43 were injured. While it may be “premature” to link the shootings at the Texas Army base to homegrown radical Islamic terrorism, the incident is similar to other recent incidents at military bases, Juan Zarate, President George W. Bush’s deputy national security adviser, said. “Unfortunately, this event follows in a line of attacks against military personnel,” said Zarate, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based policy group. Zarate pointed to a murder outside a military recruitment center in Little Rock, Arkansas, in June and killings at Camp Liberty in Iraq in May and Camp Pennsylvania in Kuwait in 2003. Premeditated Murder Major Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, has been charged by military authorities with 13 counts of premeditated murder in connection with the Fort Hood incident. The Homeland Security panel’s probe is the first congressional investigation into the shootings. Republicans have been pressing Democrats, who control Congress, for more probes into the incident. Senator Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut independent who heads the panel, has said his goal is to find out how the federal government missed detecting Hasan as a threat. He said the panel wants to talk to members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force who were collecting information on Hasan. The task force is headed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The panel also wants to interview staff at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, where Hasan completed a residency in psychiatry before transferring to Fort Hood. Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said his panel will investigate how the military handled concerns about Hasan. New Wave Zarate said the shootings raise “questions about whether we are facing a new wave of terrorism driven in part by self- radicalized actors.” Some witnesses said they thought those investigating Hasan’s behavior before the shootings may have felt reluctant to act because they were overly concerned with protecting the suspect’s religious beliefs. Retired General John Keane, the Army’s former vice chief of staff, said the military needs “clear, specific guidelines” on what constitutes jihadist behavior. “It should not be an act of moral courage for a soldier to identify a fellow solider” as a potentially dangerous Islamic extremist, he said. “It should be an obligation.” Keane was commanding officer at Fort Bragg in North Carolina during the investigation of racially motivated murders in the 1990s. He said the Fort Hood situation may be similar. At Fort Bragg, “we were wrongfully tolerating extremists in our organization,” he said. Pentagon Review Defense Secretary Robert Gates plans a broad review of the military procedures and policies that were in place before the shootings, a spokesman said. Gates wants to “assess if the department is doing everything it can to prevent” similar incidents, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said. The steps could include a review of base security and how “adverse personnel information is handled,” he said. Frances Fragos Townsend, Bush’s former assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism, said reports about Hasan’s communications and ideology indicate that investigators shouldn’t have felt restricted by his First Amendment rights. Many of the inflammatory comments “had nothing to do with his religion or speech,” she said. ‘Political Correctness’ Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, asked if “political correctness” may have contributed to authorities not stopping Hasan. “There’s no doubt in my mind that was operating here,” Keane said. Zarate disagreed and said that any reluctance may have stemmed from the perception of Hasan being a doctor conducting research. Intelligence agencies last year intercepted e-mails between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, a Muslim religious leader in Yemen known for his anti-American views. Investigators say there was nothing suspicious in the communications, and they appeared to be related to a research project. Silber said Hasan’s alleged murder spree came after U.S. authorities foiled a number of terror plots by cells and individuals, including four men placing what they believed were explosives outside a Riverdale, New York, synagogue and community center in April. In September, authorities arrested Najibullah Zazi for allegedly planning to attack New York sites with explosives. Most recently, the Internet has become a tool for spurring militants in the U.S. to act, Silber said. Charismatic religious leaders such as al-Awlaki have been effective in urging on would-be terrorists, he said. Also testifying today was Brian Jenkins, senior adviser at RAND Corp., a Santa Monica, California-based policy group. The administration provided no witnesses for the hearing.

24636,50909,15756,"13 dead, 30 wounded in dual attacks at Fort Hood, Texas",564,moak,"inshAllah we will meet him too !! Quote: Friday, November 20, 2009 The Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people in the Fort Hood massacre told a radical Muslim imam, ""I can't wait to join you"" in the afterlife, in one of several e-mails exchanged between the two men, ABC News reported on Thursday. An unnamed official ""with top secret access"" told the network 18 e-mails were exchanged between Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, who encouraged Muslims to kill U.S. troops in Iraq, from Dec. 2008 until June of this year. Other e-mails, the official said, included discussion of when jihad is considered ""appropriate,"" and if it is acceptable for innocent people to die in suicide attacks. ""Hasan told Awlaki he couldn't wait to join him in the discussions they would having over non-alcoholic wine in the afterlife,"" ABC quoted the official as saying. Hasan — with an annual salary around $92,000 — also wrote, ""My strength is my financial capabilities,"" the source said. Investigators have found the Army major donated as much as $30,000 per year to Islamic ""charities."" American authorities have found several such charities to be conduits to terrorist networks. A military analyst told ABC: ""It sounds like code words ... That he's actually either offering himself up or that he's already crossed that line in his own mind."" A joint terrorism task force overseen by the FBI learned late last year of Hasan's repeated contact with al-Awlaki. The FBI said the task force did not refer early information about Hasan to superiors because it concluded he wasn't linked to terrorism. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called it disturbing that Hasan has e-mail contact with the radical cleric in Yemen, but stressed that his review is separate from the criminal investigation into Hasan and should not be interpreted as a finger-pointing exercise against Muslims or anyone else. Investigators have said e-mails between Hasan and the imam did not advocate or threaten violence. After the shootings, al-Awlaki's Web site praised Hasan as a hero. Gates would not comment Thursday on whether he considers the Fort Hood attack a terrorist act. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, an independent, told a Senate hearing that he does, and urged a government investigation ""to learn whether the federal government could have acted in a way that would have prevented these murders from occurring."" Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, questioned whether the government failed to connect dots about Hasan. ""We must better understand why law enforcement, intelligence agencies and our military personnel system may have failed in this case,"" Collins said. Hasan's psychiatry supervisors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center had expressed concerns in May 2007 about what they described as Hasan's ""pattern of poor judgment and lack of professionalism."" President Barack Obama already has ordered a review of all intelligence related to Hasan, including his contacts with al-Awlaki, concerns raised about Hasan by some of his medical colleagues, and whether warnings were properly shared and acted upon within government agencies. Results of that inquiry are due Nov. 30. The Pentagon said Thursday it will scour its procedures for identifying volatile U.S. military service members hidden in the ranks following the Fort Hood shooting rampage and lapses that might allow others to slip through bureaucratic cracks. ""It is prudent to determine immediately whether there are internal weaknesses or procedural shortcomings in the department that could make us vulnerable in the future,"" Defense Secretary Gates said. A 45-day emergency investigation will examine personnel, medical, mental health, discharge and other policies in all corners of the vast Defense Department. It will also look at ways to improve security and emergency response at Defense Department facilities. ""The shootings at Fort Hood raise a number of troubling questions that demand complete but prompt answers,"" Gates told a Pentagon news conference. The quick review will be led by two former Pentagon officials, former Army Secretary Togo West and former Navy chief Vernon Clark. A longer, second review lasting about six months will look at what Gates called ""systemic institutional shortcomings."" Gates, who has fired several top officials in three years heading the Pentagon, did not address any possible consequences of the inquiries he announced Thursday. Gates broached little new information about the case of Hasan, the Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people and wounding more than 30 in the shootings at the Texas military post on Nov. 5. Both Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the chief goal of the Pentagon probe is preventing another such attack and improving future responses by disaster teams. West was Army secretary in the mid-1990s and later became secretary of veterans affairs. Clark was the chief of naval operations from 2000 to 2005. In 2007, Gates named West co-chairman of a panel created to review rehabilitation care problems at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington and the National Naval Medical Center in suburban Bethesda, Maryland. In 1995, as President Bill Clinton's Army Secretary, West ordered a review of the Army's racial climate, including whether there were ties between extremist groups and members of the military. The investigation was prompted by the arrests of two paratroopers in connection with the murders of two black people and concerns that the two men may have had ties to white supremacist groups.

We have killed more than 12 of those that fought us and captured others,” Al-Shabaab commander Mohamed Ali Shuqul told a news agency by telephone from Afmadow, which is close to the border with Kenya. According to witnesses hundreds of the group's fighters marched into Afmadow town in the lower Jubba region on Sunday after heavy fighting that started the previous day. Residents said they saw dead bodies on the streets as they fled the tense town. “Al-Shabaab's strategy is to stop anyone who can have an influence on the people in the areas it controls. This fighting is mainly about who should control resources and Kismayu port,” said Ahmed Ali Noor, a Mogadishu-based political analyst. Hizbul Islam and Al-shabaab have been fighting in the region for the last three months. There is no word from Hizbul Islam group about their withdrawal from Afmadow. “There could be renewed fighting because the Hizbul Islam fighters are regrouping to recapture the town,” A resident in Afmadow said.",2009,11,23,2009-11-23 00:00:00.000,3545
24890,51586,15756,"13 dead, 30 wounded in dual attacks at Fort Hood, Texas",343,Asad'Allah,"Do you know what amuses me? All this time they spend...analyzing us, trying to figure out what motivates us, how we develop these ideas, etc etc. It is all Qur'an and Sunnah. Very simple... All the classical scholars of Islam state...that in a situation that we are living in today all over the world...Jihad is Fard al Ayn. It cant be any clearer. All the four Imams have outlined what makes Jihad obligatory upon the neck of every Muslim male. It has been Fard al Ayn for a very long time. I find it amusing...how some of these cowards come and try to re-write and cover up principles that are well established in this religion. From the Qur'an, the Sunnah and the scholars. It is just quite simple. Let us just take a look at what some of the scholars of the past have said, insha'Allah. Quote: “The first obligation after Iman is the repulsion of the enemy aggressor who assaults the religion and the worldly affairs”. Ibn Tayymiya{Rahimullah} Just as the Prophet (saw) said: “It is expected that the nations will call each other from all horizons, as diners calling each other to feast from a platter of food in front of them.” A person asked the Prophet (saw) would that be because of our small number that day. The Prophet (saw) said, “No, but you will be rubbish like the rubbish of flood water. Allah will put Wahn into your hearts and remove the fear from the hearts of your enemies because of your love for the world and your hate of death”. In another narration it was said: “and what is the Wahn, O messenger of Allah?” He (saw) said: “love of the world and the hate for fighting.”*Narrated by Ahmad with a good chain. Narrated by Abu Daud with the words “hate for death”, and it is a sahih hadith. Defensive Jihad This is expelling the Kuffar from our land, and it is Fard Ayn, a compulsory duty upon all. It is the most important of all the compulsory duties and arises in the following conditions: 1) If the Kuffar enter a land of the Muslims. 2) If the rows meet in battle and they begin to approach each other. 3) If the Imam calls a person or a people to march forward then they must march. 4) If the Kuffar capture and imprison a group of Muslims. The First Condition: With reference to the Kuffar entering a land of the Muslims. In this Condition the pious predecessors, those who succeeded them, the Ulama of the four Mathhabs (Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi and Hanbali), the Muhadditheen, and the Tafseer commentators, are agreed that in all Islamic ages, Jihad under this condition becomes Fard Ayn upon the Muslims of the land which the Kuffar have attacked and upon the Muslims close by, where the children will march forth without the permission of the parents, the wife without the permission ofher husband and the debtor without the permission of the creditor. And, if the Muslims of this land cannot expel the Kuffar because of lack of forces, because they slacken, are indolent or simply do not act, then the Fard Ayn obligation spreads in the shape of a circle from the nearest to the next nearest. If they too slacken or there is again a shortage of manpower, then it is upon the people behind them, and on the people behind them, to march forward. This process continues until it becomes Fard Ayn upon the whole world. Shaykh wa Mujahid Ibn Tayymiyah[Rahimullah] says on this topic: “About the defensive jihad, which is repelling an aggressor, is the most tasking type of jihad. As agreed upon by everyone, it is obligatory to protect the religion and what is sacred. The first obligation after Iman is the repulsion of the enemy aggressor who assaults the religion and the worldly affairs. There are no conditional requirements such as supplies or transport, rather he is fought with all immediate capability .The Ulama, our peers and others have spoken about this.” Ibn Tayymiyah[Rahimullah] supports his opinion of the absence of the requirement of transport in his reply to the judge who said: “If jihad becomes Fard Ayn upon the people of a country, one of the requirements, in comparison to Hajj, is that one must have supplies and a ride if the distance is such that one shortens the prayer”. Ibn Tayymiyah[Rahimullah] said: “What the Judge has said in comparison to Hajj has not been stated before by anybody and is a weak argument. Jihad is obligatory because it is for the repulsion of the harm of the enemy, therefore it has priority over Hajj. For Hajj no transport is considered necessary. Of the jihads some take priority.” It is furthered in a sahih hadith narrated by Ebaad Bin Asaamat that the Prophet (saw) said: “It is upon the Muslim to listen and obey in hardship and prosperity , in what he likes and dislikes, and even if he is not given his rights”. Therefore, the pillar of the most important of obligations, is the marching forward in times of hardship as well as prosperity. As has been stated, contrary to Hajj, the obligation remains present in times of hardship. And this is in offensive jihad. So it is clear that defensive jihad carries a greater degree of obligation. To defend the sacred things and the religion from the aggressor is obligatory , as agreed upon by everyone. “The first obligation after Iman is repulsion of the enemy aggressor who assaults the religion and the worldly affairs.” Now we look at the opinions of the four Mathhabs who are all in agreement on this point. Opinions of the Mathhabs Hanafi Fiqh Ibn Abidin said: ” Jihad becomes Fard Ayn if the enemy attacks one of the borders of the Muslims, and it becomes Fard Ayn upon those close by. For those who are far away, it is Fard Kifaya, if their assistance is not required. If they are needed, perhaps because those nearby the attack cannot resist the enemy, or are indolent and do not fight jihad, then it becomes Fard Ayn upon those behind them, like the obligation to pray and fast. There is no room for them to leave it. If they too are unable, then it becomes Fard Ayn upon those behind them, and so on in the same manner until the jihad becomes Fard Ayn upon the whole Ummah of Islam from East to the West”. And the following have like Fatwa: AI Kassani, lbn Najim and lbn Hammam. Maliki Fiqh In Hashiyat ad Dussuqi it is stated: Jihad becomes Fard Ayn upon a surprise attack by the enemy. Dussuqi said: “Wherever this happens, jihad immediately becomes Fard Ayn upon everybody, even women, slaves, and children, and they march out even if their guardians, husbands and creditors forbid them to.” Shafi Fiqh In the Nihayat al Mahtaj by Ramli it is stated: “If they approach one of our lands and the distance between them and us becomes less than the distance permitting the shortening of prayers, then the people of that territory must defend it and it becomes Fard Ayn even upon the people for whom there is usually no jihad; the poor, the children, the slaves, the debtor and the women.” Hanbali Fiqh In al Mughni by Ibn al Qadamah it is stated: ” Jihad becomes Fard Ayn in three situations: 1) If the two sides meet in battle and they approach each other. 2) If the Kuffar enter a land, jihad becomes Fard Ayn upon its people. 3) If the Imam calls a people to march forward it is obligatory upon them to march forward.” And Ibn Tayymiyah remarked: “If the enemy enters a Muslim land, there is no doubt that it is obligatory for the closest and then the next closest to repel him, because the Muslim lands are like one land. It is obligatory to march to the territory even without the permission of parents or creditor, and the narration’s reported by Ahmad are clear on this.”~ This situation is known as the General March. walhamdullilah rabbil alamin.",2009,11,25,2009-11-25 00:00:00.000,48272

In addition, it has become a barrier in the road to a self sufficient nation.

This will help the Somali Muslim people in the short and long term, God willing, and will help to move them from being dependent to being self sufficient.

25243,52343,1893,Latest News About The Mujahideen In Somalia,343,Asad'Allah,"Hardline rebels take Somali border town near Kenya * Al Shabaab seizes border town from rivals Hizbul Islam * Civilians fleeing violence try to cross into Kenya MOGADISHU, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Rebels suspected of links to al Qaeda seized a Somali town near the Kenyan border on Saturday, sending civilians fleeing towards the neighbouring country. Al Shabaab insurgents, who Washington says are a proxy in Somalia for Osama bin Laden's group, drove into the town of Dhobley after rival insurgents, Hizbul Islam, fled. ""I see a lot of battle wagons and heavily-armed militia. They came into the town a few minutes ago and they have captured the police station ... without any fighting,"" said Dhobley resident Nor Yusuf Ali by telephone. Together, the two rebel groups have been fighting the Western-backed government in the capital Mogadishu, but a battle for control of the lucrative southern port of Kismayu has pitted the former allies against each other. Violence has plagued Somalia since 1991 and about 19,000 civilians have been killed since the start of 2007 when Islamists launched an insurgency to topple the government. Western nations and neighbouring countries fear regions under al Shabaab's control are a haven for militants hoping to launch attacks in developed countries or destabilise the region. ""We got Dhobley without any war against us. Now it is under the control of the mujahideen. We will continue our fight against the infidels till we eradicate them from the region,"" an al Shabaab official told Reuters by telephone from Dhobley. A senior official of the group said in June the insurgents might ""invade"" Kenya unless it reduced troop numbers along the border near places such as Dhobley. BORDER CLOSED Kenya shut its border with Somalia in January 2007. However, thousands of Somalis still cross the porous desert frontier to reach overflowing refugee camps in Kenya, often by bribing police along the way. ""The border is totally closed but people are trying to enter the refugee camps. Kenya has deployed more troops on the border,"" an aid agency official in Dhobley, who declined to be identified, told Reuters. The rebels have brought a semblance of stability to areas they control but their harsh practices have alienated many traditionally moderate Muslims in the failed state. ""We don't know where we are going to. I and my six young children fled from Dhobley. We have left behind everything We had, our houses and belongings,"" said Qadra Jamac as she headed to Kenya with her children late last week. ""The border is very hard to enter but we will try our luck."" The group's aim is to impose its own strict version of sharia -- Islamic law -- throughout Somalia. It has banned music, sport, videos, and shaving. They desecrate graves, behead rival clerics and publicly stone to death women accused of adultery. Al Shabaab appealed to Dhobley residents to stay put, saying they would bring order to the town a few kilometres from Kenya, but some residents left anyway, fearing more violence. ""They are rumours saying the Hizbul Islam militia is near the town ... that is why we are fleeing to the neighbouring refugee camps,"" said 54-year-old Abdi Omar. ""We don't know where to stay."" http://af.reuters.com/article/somali...091128?sp=true",2009,11,29,2009-11-29 00:00:00.000,3545

Aweys said the two groups are brothers and no one has betrayed the course of the religion, warning that more bloodshed will further derail the relationship. “We must keep our blood together as brothers, our hearts together and our rights together, ill-treating each other is prohibited, and to charge your fellow Muslims of being apostates is also prohibited in our religion” Sheikh Aweys told gathering after Eid Al-Adha prayers on Friday morning, in Alamada village at the outskirt of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. He said that the intercession between the two groups had stuck but hopes that it will soon resume to the normal course. “There was mediation talk between us and Al-Shabaab before but now the mediation talks have staled, we hope that the talks will resume soon” he noted. The 65-year old cleric has also justified that the fierce clashes going on in Mogadishu against the fragile UN-backed Somali government is rightful, but the one going on in Jubba regions is wrong because ‘it’s between Muslims’. His remarks come after Al-Shabaab ousted his group from Dobley, a key southern border town located between Somalia and Kenya. The two groups, which have been involved in armed struggle against the fragile Somali government and African Union peacekeeping force in Mogadishu, are now at loggerheads over the control of southern Somali regions, where they both have large presences.

Heavily armed Al-Shabaab militia entred the town without any military resiatance from their arch-rivals Hizbul Islam who have vacated it. Hundreds of terrified residents started fleeing the town early on Saturday, fearing worst may happen as Hizbul Islam militias are reportedly in the outskirts of the town. Hizbul Islam officials and their fighters are skirted across the border with some officials even reportedly disguised as civilians crossed the border into Kenya. A top Hizbul Islam named Isse Kamboni was on Wednesday nabbed by Kenyan security forces as he flee Al-Shabaab onslaught in southern Somalia. The bitter war between the two groups, which are involved in fighting against the fragile UN-backed Somali government in Mogadishu, has escalated into the once peaceful southern regions, where they both have large swathes under their control. The latest Al-Shabaab advance along the Kenyan border reignite fears of possible military confrontation with security forces along the border. Al-Shabaab has recently warned that it will carry out attacks inside Kenya, should the East African nation continue with its plans of training dozens of Somali youths to fight for the fragile UN-backed Somali government. In recent months, hundreds of unemployed youths from Kenya’s northeastern province have been enrolled in a military training in which they are promised to receive salaries of about $600.

In a voice message released for the commemoration of Eid ul-adha , Sheikh Mukhtar Abdirahman Abu-Zubeyr said the fighting will only stop if the current government is toppled and the foreign forces leave the war-torn country. “We will only cease fire when the current government quits and AMISOM leaves the country,” he said, urging Somalis to support their course. However, Abu-Zubeyr, unlike his previous messages, did not mention the peaceful states of Somaliland and Puntland in his latest message. The fight with Hizbul Islam, their new rivals, was also left out the topic. On the other hand, Al-Shabaab’s Spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage aka Sheikh Ali Dhere said the group would apply the same strategy it used against Ethiopian troops to forcibly thrust AU troops out of the country. The group, which has large swathes of southern and central under its control, is currently involved in heavy clashes with government and AU troops in the capital Mogadishu.

25623,53024,1893,Latest News About The Mujahideen In Somalia,930,wa1slama,"No peace for the peacekeepers in Somalia Mogadishu Wednesday 02 December 2009 SMC In a khaki tent shielded by sandbags, four Ugandan officers are watching ""Black Hawk Down,"" the Hollywood account of the devastating ambush of US troops in the chaotic streets of Mogadishu. It's maybe not the ideal cinematic fare when you are a peacekeeper supposed to be maintaining some semblance of stability in the lawless Somali capital, where life is cheap and international troops come under daily fire. That doesn't seem to bother these officers, almost transfixed in front of the screen in the mess where they came to grab a cup of milky tea. ""They know they don't have enough forces to engage us and move us back one foot,"" said Major Ba-Hoku Barigye, part of an African Union force shoring up President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed's government against Islamist fighters. ""Our major achievement is that we have been able to demystify the idea that Somalia is a no-go area,"" he boasted. ""Three years after (deployment) we're still here, and I'm sure we will be here for three more years."" Somalia has been embroiled in conflict since 1991 and Western countries -- fearful of it becoming a safe haven for Al-Qaeda -- are propping up Sharif's fragile administration in the hope it can restore some order. His government is in control of only pockets of the capital however, with the rest held by the Al-Qaeda-inspired Shebab movement and the more political Hezb al-Islam militia. The conflict stormed into Western consciousness in 1993 when two US Black Hawk choppers were shot down and the bodies of 18 US soldiers dragged through Mogadishu's streets -- the incident dramatised by Hollywood. Today's African Union peacekeeping force is made up from just Burundi and Uganda and has 5,300 troops, well below the 8,000 initially planned. Installed near Mogadishu airport, the force's headquarters is a mixture of tents, containers and prefabricated units in a forest just a few metres from the Indian Ocean. Every morning the troops don helmets and flak-jackets for patrols on board their white armoured vehicles which they use to resupply forward positions in central Mogadishu or escort Somali officials. ""Without us the transitional government would collapse immediately,"" said one colonel, whose men in forward positions regularly come under gunshot and mortar fire. The airport and seaport remain open, at least. The headquarters complex had been largely spared the effects of the daily clashes between pro-government militia and Islamist fighters, due to what one officer involved in military-civilian operations described as their friendly ties with local villagers. That was until a double suicide attack in September killed 17 peacekeepers, including their second in command, a Burundian general. The gutted white facade of the former command centre carries the scars but the officers insist that while the attack cost lives, it failed to achieve its aim of killing the force's commander in chief. Pinned up across the base is a directive to the troops to, despite the attack, make every effort to ensure Somalis are not left feeling isolated. ""We could have done better but remember that we are the only peacekeeping mission with the same risks as Afghanistan or Iraq,"" said Major Barigye. ""I'm convinced this mission can be achieved in less than a year,"" he added. ""It's just a question of capacities and human power."" The force lacks both manpower and equipment, he said. Barigye's mobile phone rings again. He picks it up. ""The Shebab have taken to calling me with threats,"" he shrugged. Every now and then there's a buzz overhead. US drones are watching and monitoring. Source: AFP",2009,12,03,2009-12-03 00:00:00.000,3545

Network) – the Islamist fighters of Jubba regions have detained several dollar exchangers in the port town of Kismayu, just after violating the order of the Islamic administration in southern Somalia, officials told Shabelle radio radio on Monday. Reports say that the arrest of the money exchangers came as they refused taking the slashed US dollars and its use which lastly brought the forces to jail them in the prison. The Islamic administration of Jubba regions issued a declaration against refusing the rough and tore dollars recently which they order all the money exchangers and business in whole towns under the control of their administration in south of the country. More people already took the declaration of the administration and used the tore American dollar through the port town of Kismayu and the other cities in Jubba regions in southern Somalia while some of them started refuting to abide by the order of the Islamic administration. More Somali exchangers who refused and took no notice about the Islamic administration’s order about the US money were captured on Sunday sent to the jail. Speaking to the media, Sheik Abu Hureira Abdurrahman, the deputy commander of the Islamist fighters of Jubba regions said that they captured more money exchangers saying they had violated the orders of the Islamic administration for taking rough and cut dollars through the town.

However, in the opinion of the head of a local human rights organization, the exhumation of the remains of the participant of armed formations, who died from his wounds, for conducting examination is a real mockery, designed by power agents with the aim to cause greatest sufferings to his relatives. The ""Caucasian Knot"" has reported that on December 3 Chechen power agents found a tomb in the dense forest of the Shelkovskoy District with remains of Turpal-Ali Dzhamalkhanov, 19, who was believed to be Amir of the militants of Tsa-Vedeno village, Vedeno District. It is supposed that Dzhamalkhanov, who was in search, as power agents assert, for the last three years for committing many grave crimes, was heavily wounded three months ago during special operation and later died from received wounds. In the opinion of the head of a local human rights organization, who preferred to remain anonymous, the exhumation of the remains of the militant, who had died from wounds and whose person had been already established, is just a mockery over the body and intention of power agents to bring sufferings to his relatives. The source of the ""Caucasian Knot"" correspondent has also noted that although recently the bodies of the participants of the armed underground, liquidated in combat clashes, are given out to their relatives, nevertheless, it is not allowed to bury them at cemeteries and administer memorial ceremonies, which is also regarded as a refined mockery.",2009,12,08,2009-12-08 00:00:00.000,1403

The U.S. is still not confirming the report, CBS News has learned. Abu Yahya al-Libi is the spiritual successor to Palestinian philosopher Abu Azzam - and the inspiration for much of Bin Laden's beliefs, according to CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent Lara Logan. He is very powerful and believed by some to be the natural successor to Bin Laden.

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani Taliban sources have denied the U.S. report claiming to have killed a top al-Qaeda leader in northwest Pakistan's tribal area, local media said Saturday. The U.S. intelligence on Friday claimed to have killed top al-Qaeda commander Abu Yahya al-Libbi in a drone attack on a car in North Waziristan tribal agency. However, the Taliban sources in the region denied the report, saying the two men killed in a Tuesday airstrike were Arabs and belonged to Saudi Arabia. The American media quoting the U.S. intelligence sources claimed one among the two men, who died in the Tuesday attack, was in fact an important al-Qaeda commander, Abu Yahya al-Libbi. He was being hunted down since his escape from a U.S. prison in Bagram, Afghanistan in 2005. After his dramatic escape from the highly fortified prison at the Bagram air base, the U.S. officials claimed, al-Libbi came to North Waziristan and set up his base camp and from there he used to send fighters across the border into Afghanistan to fight against the coalition forces. Since Friday morning, the U.S. media have started speculations that an important al-Qaeda commander had been targeted in Pakistan. First they said a high-value target was killed in a drone attack in South Waziristan on Thursday.

Quote: ASTRAKHAN – On Friday, three Chechen NVF fighters were wounded when one of the fighters, a woman, detonated a homemade grenade as Chechen police from the Staropromyslovsky District and the local FSB attempted to take them into custody outside a bank in Astrakhan. “The girl detonated a ‘Khattabka’ (homemade) grenade made from a shell. And her associate threw a similar grenade at police which exploded when it hit the ground,” a police spokesman told reporters. Both suspects were hospitalized with serious wounds. The three have been identified as the well known fighter Anvar Labazanov (alias “Kazakh” and “Palach”), his wife Aina Sidgaliyeva, and Musa Khaikharoyev. According to a police, the three were picking up money from a wire transfer from Poland to finance a terror attack when police blockaded them on the street. When police demanded that they lay down on the ground, Labazanov made a run for it and tossed a grenade at police. His wife also pulled out a grenade and detonated it, probably in an attempt to kill herself. Khairkharoyev was slightly wounded in the explosions. Nobody else was hurt (RIA Novosti; Kavkazsky Uzel; ITAR-TASS).",2010,01,15,2010-01-15 00:00:00.000,1403

May Allah(swt) Protect him: Quote: ASTRAKHAN – On Friday, three Chechen NVF fighters were wounded when one of the fighters, a woman, detonated a homemade grenade as Chechen police from the Staropromyslovsky District and the local FSB attempted to take them into custody outside a bank in Astrakhan. “The girl detonated a ‘Khattabka’ (homemade) grenade made from a shell. And her associate threw a similar grenade at police which exploded when it hit the ground,” a police spokesman told reporters. Both suspects were hospitalized with serious wounds. The three have been identified as the well known fighter Anvar Labazanov (alias “Kazakh” and “Palach”), his wife Aina Sidgaliyeva, and Musa Khaikharoyev. According to a police, the three were picking up money from a wire transfer from Poland to finance a terror attack when police blockaded them on the street. When police demanded that they lay down on the ground, Labazanov made a run for it and tossed a grenade at police. His wife also pulled out a grenade and detonated it, probably in an attempt to kill herself. Khairkharoyev was slightly wounded in the explosions. Nobody else was hurt (RIA Novosti; Kavkazsky Uzel; ITAR-TASS). Well, forgive me but I made a mistake, this news is from Nov 2009. So it's still possible that he has been arrested. A brother told me that's why ImamTV is releasing some photos of him recently. Anyway I still think it's strange...... Wa Allahu A'lem And again, sorry for the mistake.

28003,7358,2140,Jihad Unspun Founder about to be beheaded?,605,assassin,"Taliban militants shelve plans to kill Canadian hostage Abductors still holding out for ransom, but locals say release could come at any time REHMAT MEHSUD Globe and Mail Update April 7, 2009 at 6:55 PM EDT PESHAWAR, PAKISTAN — Taliban militants in Pakistan's tribal region have decided to shelve plans to kill Canadian hostage Beverly Giesbrecht, but her captors are apparently still holding out for a ransom before releasing her. “After broad-based consultations, the Shura [leadership council] has postponed indefinitely the plan to kill the woman,” said Qari, a close associate of Taliban commander Gul Bahadur who asked to be identified by his first name only. The abduction of Ms. Giesbrecht, 53, has become a sensitive issue, and tribesmen of the embattled area are reluctant to speak on the matter openly. However, some locals said that while there is no hard information about her release, it could come at any time. In a video released last month, the West Vancouver resident said her captors warned that they would behead her if their demands for $375,000 (U.S.) weren't met by the end of March. That deadline was later extended to April 6. She was seized at gunpoint in the Bannu region of northern Pakistan in November. The local government offered the captors a lower amount of money for her release, but it was rejected as “too little to be considered,” according to both a Taliban source and a tribal elder negotiating her release. “For the time being, we failed to patch up the deal to secure her release,” said a tribal elder who is part of the negotiation team and who did not want his name revealed. “But I am optimistic she will be freed.” Ms. Giesbrecht is a convert to Islam who also calls herself Khadija Abdul Qahaar. She publishes a pro-Islamic website, Jihad Unspun, and went to Pakistan last summer to conduct research as a freelance journalist. When asked about reports of her deteriorating health, the tribal elder said: “I have not met or seen her, but we are told that she often feels weak and unwell.” Neither sources within the Taliban nor the tribal negotiator would reveal any information about her translator or driver, who were also abducted. Taliban officials have previously said their fate would be decided once Ms. Giesbrecht's situation is resolved. The Canadian embassy in Islamabad has been working behind the scenes with Pakistani authorities to help secure her release. “We are in contact with all the concerned Pakistani authorities. And it is the prime responsibility of the host country to protect the lives and properties of guests,” an official with the Canadian embassy said Tuesday. An official with the local government administration in North Waziristan, a rugged region along the Afghan border, said they were “making all-out efforts to get her out from their [Taliban] captivity at every cost.” Code: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090407.whostage07/BNStory/International/home",2009,04,08,2009-04-08 00:00:00.000,4208

An official with the local government administration in North Waziristan, a rugged region along the Afghan border, said they were “making all-out efforts to get her out from their [Taliban] captivity at every cost.” http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servl...rnational/home",2009,04,09,2009-04-09 00:00:00.000,4208

28128,7577,2140,Jihad Unspun Founder about to be beheaded?,898,Waleed,"Assalaam o Alaikum, All of dear brothers who have been commenting on this topic i just want to clarify few things here. First of all i had the privilage of working with he and other brothers at Jihadunspun for a while. From my personal experience Im 100% sure by Grace of Allah that Jihadunspun was NOT a CIA site of anything. This woman started its site from her own money and continued to work on it till she had nothing. The expenses were paid largely by donations whch were not so huge anyway. The site was always in financial crisis well most of the time. In my opnion she was an honest muslimah but everyone has his weak side and certainly she was also wrong on some matters on which we disagreed. In fact some of the brother left he purely on relegious grounds that she did not obey hijab all the time and used to intermingle with non mehram men. So these alegations of her being a spy and helping CIA TO CATCH PEOPLE WHO DONATE ARE COMPLETTLY FALSE. Many sincere mujahid brothers in many countries have worked with her since JUS was first started. Yes she had some ideological issues but that can be understood as she was a convert. I dont want to talk about who kidnapped her....When the matter is solved inshallah then we will know what actually happened. May Allah protect all mujahideen and destroy the munafiqeen.

Another day, another devastating martyrdom operation against the Murtadeen, this time in al-Anbar: Quote: Suicide bomber kills 15 in west Iraq base: army 26 mins ago BAGHDAD – A suicide bomber wearing a vest packed with explosives killed at least 15 people and wounded 40 others on Thursday at a military base in Iraq's western Anbar province, the army said. The toll from the blast, the latest in a string of bombings in Iraq in recent weeks, was preliminary and likely to rise, the army said. Anbar had once been overrun with al Qaeda and other Sunni Islamist insurgents, but turned into one of Iraq's quietest provinces after Sunni tribal sheikhs turned on militants in their midst in late 2006. The blast followed an attack on a bus carrying police assigned to guard northern Iraq's oil industry in the city of Kirkuk on Wednesday. Ten people were killed in the explosion, which could have been caused by a parked car bomb or a car driven by suicide bomber, police said. (Reuters)",2009,04,17,2009-04-17 00:00:00.000,2692

You will move from a defeat to something more direr and if the country of Syria does not remain stable (even if it appears so outwardly) then the whole region will be on a volcano crater. Know this very well, and do not play with fire and challenge those whom you cannot stand fighting against. And know that the ones who have all this information about Syria are NOT unable to perform shocking strikes into the depth of Syria, and in the other countries of the world, in ""cartilages"" that cannot be expected by the Tawagheet. And the information we own about all countries is not less than already mentioned about Syria. So, O Tawagheet of Syria, your last fortifications that you made around the embassy of America, Russia and Iran, and around the main and secondary security departments, will not benefit you. It will not help you to install and spread security cameras in Damascus and other cities. as we know that you are preparing yourselves to encounter those whom you know very well, and what they did with the largest empire in history, namely your American masters, and those who assist them, when they were at the height of their glory. And you know that we founded, by the Grace of Allah alone, an Islamic state in Iraq out of nothing, and the all countries of the world led by America were against us at the height of their glory, and the Islamic state of Iraq came to light out of a country that was ruling by Baath. What you are going to do against the bearers of the true creed in Syria, Lebanon and the Islamic state of Iraq, you must first think repeatedly and excessively about your reign that is going to collapse [if this encounter occurs]. Know that our strength is not now the same as it was 7 years ago, and we have won, by the Might of Allah and His Support for us. Our power has increased and the people who distinguish between the truth and falsehood increased, and in Syria there are heroic men that are honest in wars and fight like a solid structure for the sake of standing up for their faith and their Prophet (saas). And the Muwahhideen in Syria have had practice and experiences in the fronts of Jihad. The night of tyrants has lasted long in Syria, and people are looking for freedom, might, and dignity; and the implementation is what you will witness and not just hear about, O you new slaves of Americans and Jews. I ask Allah (swt) to break the captivity of the Conqueror of the cross, the Conqueror of its Tawagheet slaves, and the Knight of the countries of Shaam: Abu Hussain, Shakir Al-Abssi, and his family and those with him, and consolidate their hearts and accept their murdered, as martyrs.

29050,9259,1165,GIMF: &quot;Glad Tiding for the Believers and Shaking for the Disbelievers&quot; Second and Final Part of the questionaire with brother Asad al-Jihad2,407,spams,"Quote: Originally Posted by insurgent The conspiracy against the Islamic state: America was about to ""officially"" announce her defeat in Iraq in opposition to the victory of the Islamic State, and more than one leader of Jihad stated this. Even the enemies of Islam confessed that the Islamic State of Iraq in the begining of its establishment was dominating most of the territories of Ahl Al-Sunnah, and it was implementing Sharia in many areas. But the slaves of America in the region, whose illegal regimes were strongly threatened by the victory of the Islamic State, everyone of them began to present a ""project"" to save America from defeat, through a fierce war against the Mujahideen and the Islamic State of Iraq. So they killed many Muslims, Mujahideen and their leaders, and also captured many. Also the honour of many females was violated, all to protect America from defeat; Allah suffices us for everything and He is the most excellent guardian. And everyone of these regimes strove hard to please America by offering the best possible solutions to enjoy her pleasure with them, so by the conduction of Allah, the Most Exalted, every project was in conflict with the other, while they were seeking the pleasure of their Zionist-crusader masters. Their conflicts appeared on the surface; as the Tawagheet of Qatar have their own project for Iraq, and Saudi has its own project, and their contest for power reflected negatively to their relationships, and much of this emerged on Media (as will be soon see). And the reason for the reduction of the insulting phenomenon between Saudi and Qatar on Media in the last years is that the Taghout Nayif bin Abdul-Aziz, and his son Muhammad, both were courting the Tawagheet of Qatar, and this is because he needs Qatar to increase his power in the region, to reach the throne of Saudi (as it will be seen soon). Know that in Saudi itself there are two wings that contest the reign because there is one ""vacancy"" for one of them, so everyone of those slaves is striving hard to please the Americans with what all what he can, to gain their pleasure and win this ""vacancy"". As with the sickness of Taghout Sultan Bin Abdul-Aziz, the contest increased between the wing of Taghout Nayif bin Abdul-Aziz and his son Muhammad on one side, and the wing of Taghout Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz on the other side. So they were competing in pleasing their American lords, each of them wanting to win the throne of Sultan Bin Abdul-Aziz, and certainly no one will sit on this throne except the one whom America is pleased with, and who is more the agent and treacherous than the other. As for Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz, he is the owner of the ""official"" project for Iraq, and the owner of the ""Awakening"" project which is based on tribalism to eliminate the Islamic State of Iraq. He brought many of the tribes chiefs to Riyadh, and he personally met with them and granted them vast amounts of money to buy their conscience , and fight under his commandment for the sake of reaching the reigning throne. His project was very successful at the begining, but later it weakened a great deal by the Grace of Allah, the Most Exalted, then the Jihad of the Islamic State of Iraq, and his project did not conclude yet. So in opposition to this project, another one emerged to compete for the pleasure of America, This one is the most dangerous, and who bear its responsibility are the treacherous Tawagheet of Al-Thani in Qatar, and the tyrant Nayif Bin Abdul-Aziz and his son Muhammad who joined them. Their project is to please America by eliminating the Islamic State of Iraq by initially founding ""The Front of Jihad And Reform"" then ""The Political Council of the Iraqi Resistance"", and then it expanded to include every group and corps that bears the name ""Islamic"", from those whom they could persuade to join them, and they made their so-called Mujahideen to be like mercenary groups and carry out the demands of America's slaves for the sake of gaining the biggest power and pleasing the Americans. No one was safe from the harm of these groups, except those whom Allah (the Most Exalted) saved, and they are very few (as will be seen soon). And the first practical step they made against the project of Salman is to establish the Istanbul Conference, and ridiculously, in Turkey again!! They revealed the real face of the enemy of Allah ""Ibrahim Ash-Shummari"", and they employed along with them the scholars of Surooriyyah, may Allah make their conspiracy a dagger in their hearts. So now in reality, the tyrant Nayif Bin Abdul-Aziz (May Allah curse him) is closer to the reign than is the tyrant Salman bin Abdul-Aziz (May Allah curse him), because Nayif and his son's wickedness is somehow sly, because it exploits the inclination of people towards Islam, so they employed the Surooriyyah scholars, and add to this their strong alliance with Al-Thani (i.e. the rulers of Qatar). As for Salman, he is the farthest from the vacant throne, because despite his wickedness, he has some stupidity that is known by everyone who associates with him. As for the tyrant Muhammad Bin Nayif, who is prepared by his father to be the ""king"" in the second generation after the sons of Abdul-Aziz, he is the one with whom the Americans are pleased, because he (as the Americans think) is the one who is able to protect the country from within, and protect the oil refineries and other American interests. He is (as they think) the one who is able to curb the Al-Qaeda Organization [[Note that Al-Qaeda released a statement about its unity under one strong and exonerated leadership, under the banner of The Al-Qaeda Organization Of The Arabian Peninsula; which shook the mainstays of the plots of Nayif and his son]]. And Muhammad Bin Nayif in the sight of his masters, is the one who is able to spread his power in the other countries, and this is how the Americans describe him in their reports and studies, and as can be observed through pursuing what is happening in reality. As Qatar, Nayif and his son use the religion and hypocrisy (which is the most extreme element in their nature), and have lots of money to support those brigades and groups, as well as the ""Al-Jazeerah channel"" (and I said in part one of this essay, that the whole power of Qatar is based on two things: Al-Jazeerah channel and money). So the channel used to (and it still does) interview the enemy of Allah ""Ibrahim Ash-Shummari"", the lying spokesman of their front, and they have no shame to repeat interviewing him till this present day to fulfil their project.
